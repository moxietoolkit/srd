# Goals Of The SRD

For starters, what's the point of an SRD? As the name implies, it is reference material. Thus, making it **easy to reference** is an obvious goal.

Additionally, Moxie is a **modular system** - easy to get stuff in and out. This aspect should be preserved.

Finally, it should be as **consistent** as possible with other Moxie projects - by using the same conventions, for instance.

## Conventions

As per **Grimwild, Chapter 1: Getting Started**:

- **Dice Notation**: The SRD uses standard dice notation in the format of "AdX". "A" is omitted if 1.
- **System Terms**: Are **bolded** only when first introduced or when clarity is needed. Emphasis is show with _italics_, sometimes **_boldly_**.
- **Pools**: Refer, specifically, to **diminishing pools**.
- **PC**: Refer, specifically, to **player characters**. Used interchangeably with "character".
- **D66 Tables**: 6x6 random tables, roll 2d6 and use one die for each row or column, your choice of which.
- **Crucibles**: d66 tables of words that are meant to be mashed together for inspiration.
- **Pronouns**: The SRD addresses the reader as "you". When employing the third person, "they" is used. "I" and "We" are only used in examples - keep authorial voice to a minimum.
