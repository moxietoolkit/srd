You can commune with plants. Roll Wits to decipher their messages, as they are truly hard to understand. You always get a **hint** or **reveal** on vigilance in places teeming with plant life.

## Visions

You can roll Presence to ask your patron for forbidden knowledge. Ask the GM a specific question. The answer may be cryptic or twisted to suit your patron's desires, but it will never be an outright lie. On a messy or grim, roll the Patience pool.

## Wayfarer

You can **push yourself** to teleport. The further or less familiar, the less precise. Max range is two days' ride away. Clear eyesight and no obstruction requires no roll, otherwise make a story roll. You can bring others, taking +1t per person.

## Weasel

If caught in a lie or red-handed, you can **push yourself** to weasel your way out—for now. You get an exit, but they definitely realize what happened soon after.

## Wilder

Your powers are inherently chaotic, either by nature or nurture, and you struggle to control them. Take +1d, but also +1t, on all psionic bastion rolls. You can never ignore thorns from any source, including your core talent. On a critical, regain the power points you just spent.

## Windcaller

Your voice carries on the winds over great distances. You can **push yourself** to summon or dismiss, but not control: _dense fog_—_diving temperatures_—_heavy rain_—_snowfall_—_strong winds_—_thunder_. You don't need anchors on weather rituals.

## Wisps

Two small spheres of your magic path float around you. Give them 2 traits: _annoying_—_capricious_—_malevolent_—_mesmerizing_—_whimsical_. They serve as touchstones. You can sacrifice one to: _assist without risk_—_distract someone_—_suffer vex in your stead_. Make story rolls to determine effects if sacrificed. They return each session.

## Wordplay

On a perfect defense roll when the situation allows for verbal quips, you make them: _embarrass themself_—_let a secret slip_—_focus on or lose track of you_. Once per session, you can **_goad_** the GM into spending suspense on conversation.
