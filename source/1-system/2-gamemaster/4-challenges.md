metadescription: 'Learn how to create and run challenges in the Moxie tabletop RPG system, including task pools, traits, moves, and fail states for complex encounters.'
---

A framework to represent **_tasks_**, **_obstacles_**, **_enemies_**, and scenarios that have greater tenacity and complexity than a single action can accomplish. **Challenges** allow you to track progress towards them, but also proactively oppose the PCs. Each has **_2 bonus suspense_** to be spent on moves relating to it, and a **_task pool_** to represent its tenacity or complexity. They can also have:

- **Traits**: Qualities they have with strong narrative impact, inflicting thorns, denying permissions, or changing vantage.
- **Moves**: Suggested impact moves they might make. These are examples, not limitations.
- **Fail States**: A trigger that signals the challenge failed, like a competing timer pool or a specific event. It prompts _Lock It In_.

Interpret these short, evocative phrases as fit the situation. Keep your own created challenges similarly brief and flexible. Some uses:

- Create a dangerous enemy or exceptionally tough task.
- Zoom in on pivotal moments.
- Zoom out to collapse related tasks into one objective.
- Turn a broad concept into an actionable objective.

## Building Challenges

1. **_Assign a task pool_** (4d, 6d, 8d) for its tenacity.
2. **_Add traits_** (1 or 2) that shape the situation. Skip the obvious _(storm is windy)_ and highlight what matters _(strong winds are blinding)_. Keep them brief and evocative.
3. **_List short, punchy moves_** (2 or 3) with flexible interpretations. These are examples, not limits. You can spend bonus suspense on other moves, or trigger these when an impact move is prompted by something else.
4. Define a fail state, a specific trigger that prevents that challenge from being accomplished. Avoid obvious outcomes _(dying in a fight)_ and focus on what creates tension _(breaking a code of honor)_. Players should know the fail state unless mystery is part of the fun — and even then, make it clear one is in play.

**Note**: _Not all of these parts are needed for a challenge._

## Using Challenges

Challenges are for moments of narrative importance. They make whatever you assign them to a proactive element in the story. Use them to spotlight what's happening — not because it's harder, but because it deserves proper screen time and presence. Introduce challenges at times like:

- An impact move is prompted.
- You _Foreshadow_ to give them fair warning.
- You _Complicate Things_ without warning.
- The PCs head straight towards trouble on their own.

## Linked Challenges

**Linked challenges** are greater, more complex interactions, like epically powerful enemies or unbelievably tense social situations. Each part of the whole has its own proactive presence in the scene. Give them traits that prompt impact moves, triggered by the fiction for dynamic interactions.

## Examples

- **8d | _Boss Guy_ | 2 suspense**
  - **Traits**: _Ruthless_
  - **Moves**: _Big Weapon_, _Command Subordinates_
  - **Fail States**:
    - _He Gets What He Wants_
