## Pools

A set of d6s used to track things like time, resources, or effort. When triggered, roll the pool and **drop** 1d for each 1-3 result. At 0d, the pool depletes and the fiction changes.

The size of a pool is **4d**/_short_, **6d**/_mid_, or **8d**/_long_. At **0d**, an event occurs, a situation ends, or a resource is depleted. Make sure to reflect the fiction - if a pool and the fiction don't match up, adjust or scrap the pool.

- If no dice are dropped from a task pool on a messy or perfect action roll, instead take a **secondary effect**. If the roll was only 1d, you can instead **push yourself** to drop the last die. In similar cases, the GM can **spend suspense** to drop the last die.

- **Drop** 1d from the pool before rolling it when a talent tells you to do so or you take the _greater effect_ critical bonus. This stacks.

Pools can be flexibly applied in many situations, usually by the GM. Some typical pools are listed below.

**_Note_**: _Pools are always notated with the size of the pool in front of it, usually written in italics_.

### Timer Pools

Events unfolding in the background. Roll during key moments, when time passes, or a after few PCs take action.

### Danger Pools

Threats becoming more likely. Roll during impact moves, major events or to increase threat level.

### Task Pools

Effort to overcome tasks. Roll when progress is made in the task, usually an action roll.

### Resource Pools

Quantity of something precious. Roll when the resource sees significant usage.
