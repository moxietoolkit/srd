## Marks

Light damage, a temporary hindrance to a stat. **_Take +1t on the next roll with that stat, then clear the mark._**

If a stat is already marked, you take **harm**  instead. As long as a stat is unmarked, even if you have its related harm, you can take a mark to it.

Marks are often combined with another mark or other consequences when inflicted directly. You also take a mark when you **push yourself**.

## Harm

Heavy damage to your mind or body, a lingering hindrance. **_This is the default damage from an impact move_** - though it can be split into
a couple of marks or other consequences.

- Heavy physical damage or stacked marks to Brawn or Agility leave you **bloodied**.
- Heavy mental damage or stacked marks to Wits or Presence leave you **rattled**.

**_Bloodied and rattled inflict +1t each on all rolls._** Taking a type of harm for the second time leaves you dropped - you're out of the scene. Make a story roll (usually 2d) - on a perfect, you're merely out until the scene ends. On a messy, things get **_even worse_**, like also taking on a condition (_4d dying_, _broken leg_, _trauma_). On a grim, things get far worse, like dying or taking on a permanent condition (_insanity_, _morality shift_).  Damage should match the tone of the scene - **tame stakes** might inflict a mark, while **dire stakes** might inflict both harm and dropped at once.

## Vex

An intense flash of emotion like _anger, fear, or confusion_. Vex is inflicted as a consequence, sometimes in addition to a mark or harm. Vex prompts an immediate, instinctive response. Choose one from **fight, flight, freeze** or **freakout**.

Interpret the response, which usually lasts a beat or two. Your PC is driven by _emotion_, but you decide how it plays out. Aim to balance what's fun, what fits the story, and what flows from the emotion.

## Conditions

Specific injuries or maladies that impact only relevant situations and are often lasting. They often come combined with harm or a mark, and can be:

- **_Urgent_**.
- **_Short-term_**.
- **_Long-term_**.
- **_Permanent_**.

**_Take +1t when a condition specifically hinders a roll_**. Conditions can also reduce your vantage, which can prohibit a roll.

Conditions clear when it makes sense, life after a scene, with rest, or when a pool tracking them depletes. They may also require treatment or another specific method to clear them.

**_You have final say on long-term and permanent conditions_**. When you take one, work with the GM to find a good fit for your PC and the situation.

## Treatment

Harm can be cleared with **_treatment_**, which requires _time_, _tools_,  and _training_. Treatment always carries risk, requiring an action roll. On a messy, they recover but other problems arise (_left with a mark_, _takes longer than expected_). On a grim, you aggravate the situation (_long-term condition_, _death_).

**_Marks can't benefit from treatment_**. They are light enough already that only time heals them; cleared with rest, rolling, or specific talents.

**_Conditions can be treated when it makes sense_**, which might require working towards a task pool or fulfilling specific requirements before it clears.

## Rest

A stretch of time between significant action. Paced for drama, not realism. **_Clear all marks and harm_**.

## Downtime

Extended breaks. Fully heal, including relevant conditions, and reset per-session talents. The GM rolls faction pools, then picks one and depletes it completely to move the story forward.
