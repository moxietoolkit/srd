## Assist

You help another PC on a roll. State **how & why**, then **_roll 1d and share the risk_**. Include your roll result with theirs for the final outcome - then each narrate your contribution, using your result and bonds as a guide.

**_You can assist when another PC's actions prompts an impact move._** You make a 1d defense roll for them.

When you **share the risk**, you open yourself up to the consequences, which can prompt a more powerful or additional impact move, or the GM can take suspense instead.

## Teamwork

When 3+ PCs work together, the GM picks who rolls the action - sometimes the most skilled, sometimes the least. The other PCs assist.

## Setup

When a previous action makes a follow-up more effective, you assist without risk. You roll 1d as a normal assist, but don't share the risk.

## Outside Assistance

When an assist or setup comes from the world, like an NPC or the environment, **_the GM rolls 1d_** to represent it.
