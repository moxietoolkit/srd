## Potency

The ability to pull off _jaw-dropping_ feats. When you have potency on a task, you ignore thorns from difficulty (_but not from other sources like damage_) and can attempt normally impossible (+3t) tasks. A **potent feat** can do things like:

- **_Group action_**: Something a team of people could accomplish with an action.
- **_Stretching Limits_**: Something just beyond normal human limitations.
- **_Mystical_**: Feats that don't fit in with the above, but have a similar narrative impact.

Potency is only concerned with difficulty thorns. It alters rolls with thorns from difficulty as such:

- **+3t**/impossible rolls become +0t/_tough_.
- **+1t**/**+2t** rolls become +0t/_tough_.
- **+0t** rolls are automatically successful if there are no thorns from other sources.
- On a messy or perfect on a +0t/+1t/+2t (from
difficulty) you gain greater effect (as a critical).

There's a _gray zone_ between jaw-dropping and too much. Something +3t is ok, but +4t is too far.

## Power Pools

The power of some talents or items, rolled in place of a stat. The same roll determines the outcome and drops dice from the pool. Even if it's automatically successful, still roll the pool when used and drop dice. You must roll all dice in the pool. The talent or item is used.

## Interrupt

Make an action roll to try to stop an impact move. This requires a specific talent. If not already involved, you now share the risk. On a messy, the GM takes or keeps suspense.

## Buffs

Beneficial effects that expand vantage, ease tasks, make rolls unnecessary, or provide outside assistance. If you give a buff to an ally that persists in your absence, you can assist relevant rolls without risk.

## Spark

Spark carries over each session and you can spend multiple spark on a single roll.

## Quarrels

Conflicts between PCs — arguments, competitions, or even violence. Quickly resolve impasses in the story — don't waste time debating! **_First, make sure all players agree to the quarrel_**. Clearly state the stakes for winning and losing, erring on the side of dramatic. **_Each player rolls 2d and the highest wins_**. Others can assist, or they can join at 2d with their own agenda. On a tie, compromise or keep quarreling.

The winner narrates how they won. Then, the loser narrates how they handle losing. The results of the quarrel are **final** — it's okay for the PC that lost to be bitter, but the story moves in the winner's direction. **_Both sides take spark._**

## Push Yourself

Expend extra effort to activate certain talents that require it. After using the talent, **_mark a related stat_** (_your choice_). Talents that require you to push yourself can be activated without a mark once per session.

## Always

If you have the ability to **_always_** succeed or receive a benefit, it holds true **_unless_** the GM makes a **Counter** move, a strong NPC trait is in play, or other extenuating circumstances arise. _In short, "always" means 95% of the time._

## Pre-session recap

Before each session (after
the first), recall the previous session and share your PC's best moment. Each player takes spark. When all are finished, the GM Recaps (taking suspense) tying all of these moments together into a proper "Previously on..." and starts the session.

## Post-session XP

After each session, **_take 1 XP_** and fill in its box. You start at level 1 and advance when you fill boxes equal to the next level (Lvl. 4 to 5 = 5 more boxes). This lets you choose a **_new talent_**.

**_The GM can award 1 bonus XP for a standout session_** (_about 1 in 4_). For a slower pace, slash each XP box before filling it.

## Level

A PC starts at level 1 and can go up to level 7. This takes 6 months of weekly play. For longer play, slow down progression.
