## Background

Your heritage, upbringing, and profession - the core of your vantage. You choose any two that most influences who you are now. Each gives you three wises, evocative key phrases that clearly expand your vantage.

## Traits

Choose 2 that strongly define you and 1 that definitely doesn't.

## Desires

Choose 2 that you strongly desire and 1 that you don't at all.

## Features

Detail your 3 most distinctive, outward features that others quickly notice.

## Talents

Special advantages and abilities that set your PC apart. At character creation, you choose a **path**, which gives you its core talent and a list of talents that align thematically with it. You gain new talents as you level, choosing from your path list or taking talents from other paths.

The path name is simply a label for organizing talents thematically. On its own, it doesn't expand vantage. However, talents to expand vantage.

## Stats

Your core capabilities rated from 1/_poor_ to 3/_great_, used for action and defense rolls.

**Brawn** is _power, menace, toughness_.
**Agility** is _precision, athletics, reflexes_.
**Wits** are _smarts, trickery, reading situations_.
**Presence** is _influence, willpower, reading people_.

- Brawn and Agility are paired **physical stats**.
- Wits and Presence are paired **mental stats**.

## Bonds

Your dynamic with each PC. Match an intensity and a nature below, or write your own. Interpret as makes sense.

| Intensity | Nature      |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Deep      | Affection   |
| Complex   | Camaraderie |
| Growing   | Curiosity   |
| Lowkey    | Doubts      |
| Playful   | Respect     |
| Tense     | Rivalry     |

Bonds are your strongest view of the other PC, and not necessarily reciprocal. You can change a bond anytime, such as in response to something they've done or something new you've learned about them. When it changes, give a short vignette. **_The other PC takes spark_**.
