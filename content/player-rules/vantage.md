# Narrative Weight

<!--

In the book, the above header is simply "Vantage". This is dumb, and Max is thinking about a different name for this header (07-Feb-2024).

## Vantage

Your character's frame of reference, the sum of their backstory, talents, and the current fiction - everything on your sheet and what's affecting you in the story. When a question arises about what you can do, have, or know, check it against your vantage: does it feel like a **_given_**, a **_stretch_** or a **_reach_**?.

**Proper vantage** opens up possibilities and gives the freedom to declare story details. Lacking it makes things fore difficult, or even impossible.

## Tools Of The Trade

You're assumed to have the gear and skills that are a given for your vantage. This avoids detailed tracking and ensures PCs are competent where it makes sense.

## Details

Use the details on your sheet as creative inspiration - _and limitations!_ - for roleplaying. They are player _(not GM)_ tools. When unsure of your PC's actions or thoughts, play towards or even against a relevant detail. Update details as the story unfolds, announcing the change and giving a vignette to _give it weight_ and _clearly convey_ the change to the other players.
