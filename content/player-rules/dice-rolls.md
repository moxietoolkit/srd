# Dice Rolls

## Action Roll

Roll to pull off something risky. State **how & why**, calrifying your intent. The GM picks the stat that matches your intentions.

- **Perfect**: You do it, and avoid trouble.
- **Messy**: You do it, but there's trouble. _Prompts an impact move_.
- **Grim**: You fail, and there's trouble. _Prompts an impact move_.

The GM makes an impact move to introduce consequences. You don't get a defense roll against impact moves prompted by your own action rolls - avoiding danger is already factored into the roll.

## Defense Roll

Roll to avoid incoming trouble, **_but only when not caused by your own action_**. The GM calls for the roll and picks a stat to test.

- **Perfect**: You avoid the trouble.
- **Messy**: You avoid the brunt of the trouble. _The GM lightens the consequences_.
- **Grim**: You fail to avoid trouble. _The GM follows through on the move_.

The GM calls for defense rolls when they target you directly with an impact move. On a messy, there's still some trouble, like taking lesser damage, losing the chance to act or being in a worse position.

**_Defense is cinematic - a reaction, out of your hands_**. The GM picks the stat to fit the danger, your PC's likely reaction, vulnerabilities, and what feels right for the moment. This keeps it varied - you can't always use a strong stat.

## Montage Roll

Roll to condense a seequence you don't want to play out in detail, but still want to leave it up to the dice. **_Roll 2d_**, resolving it all as a single action roll, then narrate a few beats. Keep things moving or zoom in on a grim.

If multiple PCs join, **_each rolls 2d and shares the risk_**. Collaborate on the results. 6s on separate rolls don't count towards criticals.
