# Running Moxie

As the GM, you play the game by a different set of rules, utilizing the tools laid out in this chapter to craft an engaging and dynamic game. You wield GM moves and suspense to drive the narrative forward, challenges to model difficult tasks, the combat kit to create thrilling battles, and story rolls along with the GM crucible for inspiration when the unexpected arises.

Your primary role is mapping fiction to mechanics, keeping the players immersed in the story while you seamlessly weave the rules into the narrative, and know when to instead ditch a rule and just let the narrative take over.

Above all, be creative. Use the mechanics as a springboard to manufacture drama, tension, and memorable moments.

## Story Rolls

Roll to disclaim decision-making, letting the dice decide story questions when you don’t want to, like an NPC’s reaction, off-screen action, or how good or bad something that just happened is. You can also collapse any rule back to a story roll when there's no specific mechanic to map it to. Roll dice based on the odds of a favorable outcome for the chosen perspective. _Are you rolling for the fish or the fisherman?_

Use **1d for Bad Odds, 2d for Even Odds** and **3d for Good Odds**.

- **Perfect**: It's the ideal situation.
- **Messy**: It's okay, but there's a catch.
- **Grim**: It's not good, and now it's a problem.

## GM Crucible

A forge for inspiration, encouraging emergent, low-prep gameplay. Turn to the GM crucible, often along with a story roll, when you want the seed of an idea to expand upon to help answer questions about the story. Roll once on each table. Each roll gives two results _(3, 1 = 31: precarious or 13: broken)_. Let your mind drift towards the most evocative, then drill down on it and interpret what it might mean.
