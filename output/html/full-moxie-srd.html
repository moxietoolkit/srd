<h1>Playing With Moxie</h1>
<p>Sourcebook: Grimwild</p>
<p>The <em>Moxie</em> ruleset is designed for <strong>cinematic gameplay</strong>. The heart of that is <strong><em>narrative collaboration</em></strong>. It&#39;s all about creating a <em>shared imagination space, managing the spotlight, and diving into narration</em>. The rules will get you halfway there — they&#39;re all pointing towards keeping the pace flowing quickly and the action dramatic. The other half is in your hands, the players at the table, and the attitude you all approach the game with.</p>
<h2>Play Cinematically</h2>
<p><strong><em>Trust in the collaborative process.</em></strong> Everyone at the table adds details into the story. You have to work together and play off of each other or the game, and the story you&#39;re telling, will fall flat.</p>
<p><strong><em>Use the camera, your shared imagination.</em></strong> Each player has two perspectives, from your character and as the audience watching this TV show. Use the camera and vivid description to paint a cool scene in everyone&#39;s mind.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tell us what it looks like, before and after your rolls.</em></strong> Give details about what you do, don’t just leave it at broad statements. Zoom in and out. Use the camera to show things outside of your own character as well — pan around, cut to other scenes, and describe NPCs. Invoke cinematic vibes and create great scenes.</p>
<h2>Play In Good Faith</h2>
<p><strong><em>Don’t be a weasel.</em></strong> Do what your character would do, then let the GM map it back to the rules. Don’t overdo it trying to work your way into better rolls. The fun is letting the story flow naturally. When you ask the rules what happens next, follow where it points with enthusiasm.</p>
<p><strong><em>Separate player and character knowledge.</em></strong> It’s more fun when everyone knows what’s going on in the game. Don’t keep secrets from each other, keep them from characters. As a player, be aware of what your character knows and doesn’t know and play towards both.</p>
<p><strong><em>Use the meta-channel sparingly.</em></strong> This is conversation about the game between players. It’s unavoidable, but minimize it to keep that shared imagination in sync at the table. For anything longer than a quick question, call for a pause to talk things through, a clean break point to resume from later.</p>
<p><strong><em>Know the rules.</em></strong> When playing a game Made With Moxie, you can always take a look at this SRD for a refresher. The rules say a lot about the types of stories to be told with the game, and the less time you spend talking about the rules, the more time you have for roleplaying. Making a cheat sheet on rules you often forget can be a big help, or even just skimming the books you&#39;re using pre-game.</p>
<h2>Play To Tell A Story</h2>
<p>Think of the game as a series of improv prompts, posed by yourselves and the rules. When you respond to them, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What would my character do?</em></li>
<li><em>What would make for a cool scene?</em></li>
<li><em>What would move the story forward?</em></li>
<li><em>What opens the door to get others involved?</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Don’t talk yourself out of fun.</em></strong> The first idea that jumps into your head is often the one you should go with. Don’t overthink or rationalize yourself out of it. Like any great TV show character, go where the fun lies. Great stories involve excitement, danger, and hard choices.</p>
<p><strong><em>Open doors and step through them.</em></strong> The best scenes involve characters playing off of each other, so make chances for others to get involved. When someone invites you into a scene, step through that door — even if it means a bit of mental gymnastics to justify your character’s actions. And as long as you step through the door at times, remember that it can be just as interesting to close the door instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Work the spotlight.</em></strong> There’s no turn order of any kind, but there is screen time. Strive to make sure everyone gets their fair share, including yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grab the spotlight</strong> when there&#39;s a lull or you have a great idea.</li>
<li><strong>Share the spotlight</strong> by opening doors or following up on another PC&#39;s actions.</li>
<li><strong>Pass the spotlight</strong> when you&#39;ve been holding it too long.</li>
<li><strong>Point the spotlight</strong> to see another PC&#39;s response or what they&#39;ve been up to.</li>
<li><strong>Never steal the spotlight.</strong> Everyone works hard to set up their moment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Don&#39;t play to win, play to tell stories.</em></strong> Work towards the same goal — to tell a great story where everyone&#39;s PC has a chance to grow. Failure isn&#39;t losing, it&#39;s just another opportunity to have a great scene. Of course, your character wants to succeed! However, your goal as a player is keeping the story interesting. Play into the bad luck just as you do the good to help ensure you craft compelling stories.</p>
<h2>Play Characters That Grow</h2>
<p><strong><em>Leave lots of blank space.</em></strong> Your PC starts with apast and connections to the world, but it&#39;s best as latticework. Learn who they are through play. Leave space for the other PCs and story to fit in.</p>
<p><strong><em>Don’t be afraid to change.</em></strong> PCs often go through hell. Any dramatic story has adversity. Let what happens change who they are. Announce what your PC&#39;s thinking, especially big shifts. If nobody else at the table knows, it’s not really happening in that shared imagination.</p>
<p><strong><em>Don’t be afraid to stay the same.</em></strong> Some aspects of your character might be immutable. That’s also part of what makes a great character. There can be those things they will stick to, even to the bitter end. Just make sure it’s worth it, and fun. Don’t die on small hills — die on entertaining ones.</p>
<p><strong><em>Make time for smaller moments.</em></strong> Quiet time, a conversation about nothing, introspection, reflection — these make for great scenes to flesh out your characters and the world. Don&#39;t just rush from action scene to action scene.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Most importantly, do stuff!</em></strong> Find reasons to get into the spotlight, push story arcs forward, and make fun scenes. When there&#39;s no opportunity, add some details to the story to create one!</h2>

<h1>Core Rules</h1>
<p>Sourcebook: Grimwild</p>
<h2>Core Mechanic</h2>
<p>When things get <em>risky</em> and <em>dramatic</em>, roll to see what happens. Grab a few d6 dice (<em>d</em>) equal to the stat the GM picks to test, roll them, and take the highest to determine the <strong>outcome</strong> - 6: <strong>Perfect</strong>, 4-5: <strong>Messy</strong>, 1-3: <strong>Grim</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>critical</strong> happens when you roll two or more 6s. <strong><em>Ignore any cuts</em></strong> and choose a <strong>critical bonus</strong>: <em>greater effect</em> - <em>secondary effect</em> - <em>setup a follow up</em>.</li>
<li>A <strong>disaster</strong> happens when a grim is cut by a <strong>thorn</strong>. Whatever the risk was before, <em>double it</em> - the worst case scenario comes to pass.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thorns</h2>
<p>One or two d8s (<em>t</em>) added to your roll by the GM to reflect a tougher than normal task. Each 7 or 8 on a thorn <strong>cuts</strong> a roll&#39;s outcome by one step - perfect becomes messy, messy becomes grim, grim becomes a disaster.</p>
<p>A normal roll is +0t/<em>tough</em>. The GM adds thorns with their <em>gut feeling</em>, given the situation. They can make it +1t/<em>very tough</em> or +2t/<em>extremely tough</em>. If it&#39;s at +3t, the task can&#39;t be done - break it up into steps or try a new approach.</p>
<p>If needed, the GM can assess difficulty factors to determine how many thorns to add:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intrinsic</strong>: Scale, opposing skill, numbers...</li>
<li><strong>External</strong>: Environment, training, tools...</li>
<li><strong>Intangible</strong>: Strong feelings, bad information, a curse...</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Damage</strong> to a PC also adds thorns to a roll, but they don&#39;t count towards making it <em>impossible</em>.</p>
<h2>Smooth Flow</h2>
<h2>If a grim threatens to grind the story to a halt, the GM can <strong>keep things moving</strong> - you get what you want, but in a way that makes things much worse. If a roll somehow turns out to have no effect, you learn new info or setup for a follow up.</h2>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h1>Working Together</h1>
<p>Sourcebook: Grimwild</p>
<h2>Assist</h2>
<p>You help another PC on a roll. State <strong>how &amp; why</strong>, then <strong><em>roll 1d and share the risk</em></strong>. Include your roll result with theirs for the final outcome - then each narrate your contribution, using your result and bonds as a guide.</p>
<p><strong><em>You can assist when another PC&#39;s actions prompts an impact move.</em></strong> You make a 1d defense roll for them.</p>
<p>When you <strong>share the risk</strong>, you open yourself up to the consequences, which can prompt a more powerful or additional impact move, or the GM can take suspense instead.</p>
<h2>Teamwork</h2>
<p>When 3+ PCs work togetherm the GM picks who rolls the action - sometimes the most skilled, sometimes the least. The other PCs assist.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>When a previous action makes a follow-up more effect, you assist without risk. You roll 1d as a normal assist, but don&#39;t share the risk.</p>
<h2>Outside Assistance</h2>
<h2>When an assist or setup comes from the world, like an NPC or the environment, <strong><em>the GM Rolls 1d</em></strong> to represent it.</h2>

<h1>Dice Rolls</h1>
<p>Sourcebook: Grimwild</p>
<h2>Action Roll</h2>
<p>Roll to pull off something risky. State <strong>how &amp; why</strong>, calrifying your intent. The GM picks the stat that matches your intentions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perfect</strong>: You do it, and avoid trouble.</li>
<li><strong>Messy</strong>: You do it, but there&#39;s trouble. <em>Prompts an impact move</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Grim</strong>: You fail, and there&#39;s trouble. <em>Prompts an impact move</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The GM makes an impact move to introduce consequences. You don&#39;t get a defense roll against impact moves prompted by your own action rolls - avoiding danger is already factored into the roll.</p>
<h2>Defense Roll</h2>
<p>Roll to avoid incoming trouble, <strong><em>but only when not caused by your own action</em></strong>. The GM calls for the roll and picks a stat to test.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perfect</strong>: You avoid the trouble.</li>
<li><strong>Messy</strong>: You avoid the brunt of the trouble. <em>The GM lightens the consequences</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Grim</strong>: You fail to avoid trouble. <em>The GM follows through on the move</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The GM calls for defense rolls when they target you directly with an impact move. On a messy, there&#39;s still some trouble, like taking lesser damage, losing the chance to act or being in a worse position.</p>
<p><strong><em>Defense is cinematic - a reaction, out of your hands</em></strong>. The GM picks the stat to fit the danger, your PC&#39;s likely reaction, vulnerabilities, and what feels right for the moment. This keeps it varied - you can&#39;t always use a strong stat.</p>
<h2>Montage Roll</h2>
<p>Roll to condense a seequence you don&#39;t want to play out in detail, but still want to leave it up to the dice. <strong><em>Roll 2d</em></strong>, resolving it all as a single action roll, then narrate a few beats. Keep things moving or zoom in on a grim.</p>
<h2>If multiple PCs join, <strong><em>each rolls 2d and shares the risk</em></strong>. Collaborate on the results. 6s on separate rolls don&#39;t count towards criticals.</h2>

<h1>Diminishing Pools</h1>
<p>Sourcebook: Grimwild</p>
<h2>Pools</h2>
<p>A set of d6s used to track things like time, resources or effort. When triggered, roll the pool and <strong>drop</strong> 1d for each 1-3 result. At 0d, the pool depletes and the fiction changes.</p>
<p>The size of a pool is <strong>4d</strong>/<em>short</em>, <strong>6d</strong>/<em>mid</em>, or <strong>8d</strong>/<em>long</em>. At <strong>0d</strong>, an event occurs, a situation ends or a resource is depleted. Make sure to reflect the fiction - if a pool and the fiction don&#39;t match up, adjust or scrap the pool.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If not dice are dropped from a task pool on a messy or perfect action roll, instead take a <strong>secondary effect</strong>. If the roll was only 1d, you can instead <strong>push yourself</strong> to drop the last die.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Drop</strong> 1d from the pool before rolling it when a talent tells you to do so, you have potency or you take the <em>greater effect</em> critical bonus. This stacks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pools can be flexibly applied in many situations, usually by the GM. Some typical pools are listed below.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: <em>Pools are always notated with the size of the pool in front of it, usually written in italics</em>.</p>
<h3>Timer Pools</h3>
<p>Events unfolding in the background. Roll during key moments, when time passes, or a after few PCs take action.</p>
<h3>Danger Pools</h3>
<p>Threats becoming more likely. Roll during impact moves, major events or to increase threat level.</p>
<h3>Task Pools</h3>
<p>Effort to overcome tasks. Roll when progress is made in the task, usually an action roll.</p>
<h3>Resource Pools</h3>
<h2>Quantity of something precious. Roll when the resource sees significant usage.</h2>

<h1>Narrative Weight</h1>
<p>Sourcebook: Grimwild</p>
<h2>Vantage</h2>
<p>Your character&#39;s frame of reference, the sum of their backstory, talents, and the current fiction - everything on your sheet and what&#39;s affecting you in the story. When a question arises about what you can do, have, or know, check it against your vantage: does it feel like a <strong><em>given</em></strong>, a <strong><em>stretch</em></strong> or a <strong><em>reach</em></strong>?.</p>
<p><strong>Proper vantage</strong> opens up possibilities and gives the freedom to declare story details. Lacking it makes things fore difficult, or even impossible.</p>
<h2>Tools Of The Trade</h2>
<p>You&#39;re assumed to have the gear and skills that are a given for your vantage. This avoids detailed tracking and ensures PCs are competent where it makes sense.</p>
<h2>Details</h2>
<h2>Use the details on your sheet as creative inspiration - <em>and limitations!</em> - for roleplaying. They are player <em>(not GM)</em> tools. When unsure of your PC&#39;s actions or thoughts, play towards or even against a relevant detail. Update details as the story unfolds, announcing the change and giving a vignette to <em>give it weight</em> and <em>clearly convey</em> the change to the other players.</h2>

<h1>Character Details</h1>
<p>Sourcebook: Grimwild</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Your heritage, upbringing, and profession - the core of your vantage. You choose any two that most influences who you are now. Each gives you three wises, evocative key phrases that clearly expand your vantage.</p>
<h2>Traits</h2>
<p>Choose 2 that strongly define you and 1 that definitely doesn&#39;t.</p>
<h2>Desires</h2>
<p>Choose 2 that you strong desire and 1 that you don&#39;t at all.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Detail your 3 most distinctive, outward features that others quickly notice.</p>
<h2>Talents</h2>
<p>Special advantages and abilities that set your PC apart. At character creation, you choose a <strong>path</strong>, which gives you its core talent and a list of talents that align thematicalyl with it. You gain new talents as you level, choosing from your path list or taking talents from other paths.</p>
<p>The path name is simply a label for organizing talents thematically. On its own, it doesn&#39;t expand vantage. However, talents to expand vantage.</p>
<h2>Stats</h2>
<p>Your core capabilities rated from 1/<em>poor</em> to 3/<em>great</em>, used for action and defense rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Brawn</strong> is <em>power, menace, toughness</em>.
<strong>Agility</strong> is <em>precision, athletics, reflexes</em>.
<strong>Wits</strong> are <em>smarts, trickery, reading situations</em>.
<strong>Presence</strong> is <em>influence, willpower, reading people</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brawn and Agility are paired <strong>physical stats</strong>.</li>
<li>Wits and Presence are paired <strong>mental stats</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bonds</h2>
<p>Your dynamic with each PC. Match an intensity and a nature below, or write your own. Interpret as makes sense.</p>

<h1>Creative Freedom</h1>
<p>Sourcebook: Grimwild</p>
<h2>Set Dressing</h2>
<p>Add minor, common sense details freely. Make assumptions and add <em>set dressing</em> to scenes to play off of to keep things flowing dynamically. There&#39;s no need to check in with the GM - they&#39;ll step in if a detail goes beyond set dressing. Anything that&#39;s a <em>given</em> for your vantage, like knowing someone or having equipment that makes sense, is set dressing.</p>
<h2>Tangles</h2>
<p>Character-driven complications you introduce into a scene and have to follow-up on. In return, you take spark. Tangles must stem from your vantage or story arcs nad always have an immediate impact, like an action roll, an option closing off, or forcing inaction at an important moment. These are things like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Unwise decisions</em></strong> your PC would likely make.</li>
<li><strong><em>Personal motivations</em></strong> over group goals.</li>
<li><strong><em>Complications</em></strong> from beliefs or backstory.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Story</h2>
<p><em>Pure cinematic momentum</em>. Each session you have <strong>2 story</strong>. Spend it to add <strong><em>story details</em></strong> that go beyond set dressing, creating new opportunities or shifting the scene in your favor. Added details must fit your vantage, <em>at least as a stretch</em>, or tie to a story arc. Example details:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Character</em></strong>: Gear, contacts, backstory...</li>
<li><strong><em>Scene</em></strong>: NPC actions, objects, atmospherics...</li>
<li><strong><em>Setting</em></strong>: History, geography, factions...</li>
</ul>
<p>Added details can&#39;t override rolls or contradict the established story. If your detail affects another PC, get permission. The GM can make a story roll to see how true or beneficial it is, or add nuance. On a grim, it may backfire! The GM can also veto details to keep things coherent.</p>
<h2>There are <em>gray zones</em> between set dressing, story details, and details simply too impactful to add. Set boundaries with your group.</h2>

<p>Group arc unite players around a theme, while character arcs help you express your own story. Most importantly, they give you authorial power - you can use story or tangles to add story details tied to your arcs to bring them into play!</p>
<h2>Story arcs signal to the GM that you want <strong><em>drama, dilemmas</em></strong> and <strong><em>opportunities</em></strong> to rise around them. Aim to resolve arcs within 3-5 sessions to keep things fresh. For struggles, get group permission - limiting them to a few sessions and involving everyone makes it fun.</h2>

<h1>Damage</h1>
<p>Sourcebook: Grimwild</p>
<h2>Marks</h2>
<p>Lesser damage, a temporary hindrance to a stat. <strong><em>Take +1t on the next roll with that stat, then clear the mark.</em></strong></p>
<p>If a stat is already marked, mark its paired stat instead. If both are already marked, take the related <strong>harm</strong>. Note that a mark can be taken even if you have the related harm.</p>
<p>Marks are often combined with another mark or other consequences when inflicted directly. You also take a mark when you <strong>push yourself</strong>.</p>
<h2>Harm</h2>
<p>A hard hit your mind or body, general damage that doesn&#39;t need to be tracked in detail. <strong><em>This is the default damage from an impact move</em></strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical damage leaves you <strong>bloodied</strong></li>
<li>Mental damage leaves you <strong>rattled</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Bloodied and rattled each inflict +1t on all rolls</em></strong>. However, when you have harm, you ignore thorns from marks to the related stats and the marks don&#39;t clear. Getting bloodied or rattled a second time leaves you <strong>dropped</strong> - you&#39;re out of the scene. Make a story roll (<em>usually 2d</em>) to see if you&#39;re just out temporarily, take a condition, or wind up dead.</p>
<p>Although bloodied and rattled are the default, especially dangerous attacks with <strong>high risk</strong> can lead straight to dropped, while <strong>low risk</strong> situations might leave you with a mark by default.</p>
<p>A messy defense roll leaves you with lesser damage - dropped becomes bloodied, rattled becomes a mark.</p>
<h2>Conditions</h2>
<p>Specific injuries or maladies that impact only relevant situations and are often lasting. They often come combined with harm or a mark, and can be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Urgent</em></strong>.</li>
<li><strong><em>Short-term</em></strong>.</li>
<li><strong><em>Long-term</em></strong>.</li>
<li><strong><em>Permanent</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Take +1t when a condition specifically hinders a roll</em></strong>. It can also make an attempt impossible.</p>
<p>Conditions clear when it makes sense, life after a scene, with rest, or when a pool tracking them depletes. They may also require treatment or another specific method to clear them.</p>
<p><strong><em>You have final say on long-term and permanent conditions</em></strong>. When you take one, work with the GM to find a good fit for your PC and the situation.</p>
<h2>Vex</h2>
<p>An intense flash of emotion like <em>anger, fear, or confusion</em>. Vex is inflicted as a consequence, sometimes in addition to a mark or harm. <strong><em>You can also spend spark to take vex in place of rattled</em></strong>, if it fits the situation. Vex prompts an immediate, instinctive response. Choose one from <strong>fight, flight, freeze</strong> or <strong>freakout</strong>.</p>
<h2>Interpret the response. Your PC is <em>driven by emotion</em>, but you decide how it plays out. Aim to balance what&#39;s fun and what fits the story. <strong><em>If there&#39;s a follow-up roll, take +1t on it</em></strong>. After the response, which always takes a beat or two, clear the vex.</h2>

<h1>Recovery</h1>
<p>Sourcebook: Grimwild</p>
<h2>Healing</h2>
<p><strong><em>When you get bloodied or rattled, start a 4d pool</em></strong> to track its healing. When you <strong>heal</strong> harm from rest, treatment, or another source, roll the pool. At 0d, clear the harm. <strong><em>Treatment</em></strong> requires <em>time, tools, training</em> and carries risk, and each pool can benefit from treatment only a single time.</p>
<p><strong><em>Marks can&#39;t benefit from treatment</em></strong>. They are light enough already that only time heals them. They can only be cleared with rest, talents or rolling.</p>
<h2>Rest</h2>
<p>A stretch of time between significant action. Paced for drama, not realism. Clear all marks and heal (roll pools).</p>
<h2>Downtime</h2>
<h2>Extended breaks. Fully heal and reset per-session talents. The GM rolls faction pools. After, they pick and deplete one to move the story forward. You can roll a montage to achieve something non-pivotal.</h2>

<h1>Odds &amp; Ends</h1>
<p>Sourcebook: Grimwild</p>
<h2>Potency</h2>
<p>The ability to pull off <em>jaw-dropping</em> feats. When you have potency on a task, you ignore thorns from difficulty (<em>but not from other sources like damage</em>) and can attempt normally impossible (+3t) tasks. A <strong>potent feat</strong> can do things like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Group action</em></strong>: Something a team of people could accomplish with an action.</li>
<li><strong><em>Stretching Limits</em></strong>: Something just beyond normal human limitations.</li>
<li><strong><em>Mystical</em></strong>: Feats that don&#39;t fit in with the above, but have a similar narrative impact.</li>
</ul>
<p>Potency is only concerned with difficulty. It makes a normally +3t/<em>impossible</em> roll possible at +0t. On a +1t/<em>very tough</em> or +2t/<em>extremely tough</em> roll, you take <em>greater effect</em> (critical). On a +0t roll, you automatically succeed.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a <em>gray zone</em> between jaw-dropping and too much. Something +3t is ok, but +4t is too far.</p>
<h2>Power Pools</h2>
<p>The power of some talents or items, rolled as part of using it or in place of a stat. The same roll determines the outcome and drops dice from the pool. <strong><em>You can roll fewer dice to risk losing less</em></strong>. Roll when the talent or item is used.</p>
<h2>Buffs</h2>
<p>Beneficial effects that expand vantage, ease tasks, make rolls unnecessary, or provide outside assistance. If you give a buff to an ally that persists in your absence, you can assist relevant rolls without risk.</p>
<h2>Quarrels</h2>
<p>Conflicts between PCs — arguments, competitions, or even violence. Quickly resolve impasses in the story — don&#39;t waste time debating! <strong><em>First, make sure all players agree to the quarrel</em></strong>. Clearly state the stakes for winning and losing, erring on the side of dramatic. <strong><em>Each player rolls 2d and the highest wins</em></strong>. Others can assist, or they can join at 2d with their own agenda. On a tie, compromise or keep quarreling.</p>
<p>The winner narrates how they won. Then, the loser narrates how they handle losing. The results of the quarrel are <strong>final</strong> — it&#39;s okay for the PC that lost to be bitter, but the story moves in the winner&#39;s direction. <strong><em>Both sides take spark.</em></strong></p>
<h2>Push Yourself</h2>
<p>Expend extra effort to activate certain talents that require it. After using the talent, <strong><em>mark a related stat</em></strong> (<em>your choice</em>). Talents that require you to push yourself can be activated without a mark once per session.</p>
<h2>Interrupt</h2>
<p>Make an action roll to try to stop an impact move. This requires a specific talent. If not already involved, you now share the risk. On a messy, the GM takes or keeps suspense.</p>
<h2>Always</h2>
<p>If you have the ability to <strong><em>always</em></strong> succeed or receive a benefit, it holds true <strong><em>unless</em></strong> the GM makes a <strong>Counter</strong> move, a strong NPC trait is in play, or other extenuating circumstances arise. <em>In short, &quot;always&quot; means 95% of the time.</em></p>
<h2>Level</h2>
<h2>A PC starts at level 1 and can go up to level 7. This takes 6 months of weekly play. For longer play, slow down progression (<em>below</em>).</h2>

<h1>Beginning &amp; Ending Sessions</h1>
<p>Sourcebook: Grimwild</p>
<h2>Pre-Session Recap</h2>
<p>Before each session (afterthe first), recall the previous session and share your PC&#39;s best moment. <strong><em>Each player takes spark.</em></strong> When all are finished, the GM <strong>recaps</strong> (<em>taking suspense</em>) tying all of these moments together into a proper <em>&quot;Previously on...&quot;</em> and starts the session.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note</em></strong><em>: Spark carries over and story resets each session.</em></p>
<h2>Post-Session XP</h2>
<p>After each session, <strong><em>take 1 XP</em></strong> and fill in its box. You start at level 1 and advance when you fill boxes equal to the next level <em>(Lvl. 4 to Lvl. 5 means 5 more boxes)</em>. This lets you choose a <strong><em>new talent</em></strong>.</p>
<h2><strong><em>The GM can award 1 bonus XP for a standout session</em></strong> <em>(about 1 in 4)</em>. For a slower pace, slash each XP box before filling it.</h2>

<h1>Running Moxie</h1>
<p>Sourcebook: Grimwild</p>
<p>As the GM, you play the game by a different set of rules, utilizing the tools laid out in this chapter to craft an engaging and dynamic game. You wield GM moves and suspense to drive the narrative forward, challenges to model difficult tasks, the combat kit to create thrilling battles, and story rolls along with the GM crucible for inspiration when the unexpected arises.</p>
<p>Your primary role is mapping fiction to mechanics, keeping the players immersed in the story while you seamlessly weave the rules into the narrative, and know when to instead ditch a rule and just let the narrative take over.</p>
<h2>Above all, be creative. Use the mechanics as a springboard to manufacture drama, tension, and memorable moments.</h2>

<h1>Story Rolls</h1>
<p>Sourcebook: Grimwild</p>
<p>Roll to disclaim decision-making, letting the dice decide story questions when you don’t want to, like an NPC’s reaction, off-screen action, or how good or bad something that just happened is. You can also collapse any rule back to a story roll when there&#39;s no specific mechanic to map it to. Roll dice based on the odds of a favorable outcome for the chosen perspective. <em>Are you rolling for the fish or the fisherman?</em></p>
<p>Use <strong>1d for Bad Odds, 2d for Even Odds</strong> and <strong>3d for Good Odds</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Perfect</strong>: It&#39;s the ideal situation.</li>
<li><strong>Messy</strong>: It&#39;s okay, but there&#39;s a catch.</li>
<li><strong>Grim</strong>: It&#39;s not good, and now it&#39;s a problem.</li>
</ul>
<h2>GM Crucible</h2>
<p>A forge for inspiration, encouraging emergent, low-prep gameplay. Turn to the GM crucible, often along with a story roll, when you want the seed of an idea to expand upon to help answer questions about the story. Roll once on each table. Each roll gives two results <em>(3, 1 = 31: precarious or 13: broken)</em>. Let your mind drift towards the most evocative, then drill down on it and interpret what it might mean.---</p>

<h1>Moves</h1>
<p>Sourcebook: Grimwild</p>
<p>A framework for good GMing practices and <strong><em>the rules that you, the GM, play by</em></strong>. While they can be called out specificallym they typically sit in the background left unsaid, aligning naturally with what you do as GM.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Story moves</em></strong> set up scenes and pace the game. They hint at problems and give players a chance to react to what&#39;s happening. <em>Make theses moves as you like at any time.</em></li>
<li><strong><em>Suspense moves</em></strong> help the players out in some way or escalate tension. <strong><em>Take suspense when used.</em></strong> <em>Make these moves with good timing.</em></li>
<li><strong><em>Impact moves</em></strong> deal significant consequences, crank up the tension, and make the world feel powerful. <em>Make these moves when prompted.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Prompt</h2>
<p>A trigger for you to make an impact move, caused by things like grim or messy action rolls, a relevant depleted pool, an unaddressed <em>Foreshadow</em> move, or by spending suspense.</p>
<h2>Suspense</h2>
<p><em>Pure rising tension and cinematic timing</em>. Gain suspense by skipping a prompted impact move or making a suspense move. Spend it to prompt an impact move at any time.</p>
<p>Skipping an impact move feels like the PCs got off lucky — something should have happened, but didn&#39;t. That lingering suspense builds tension, ready to strike later. Use this when no immediate move feels compelling or when you want to shift focus to other scenes.</p>
<h2>Hit With Impact</h2>
<h3>Consequences</h3>
<p>What happens when things go wrong — from failed rolls, timers, or impact moves. They should feel <strong><em>hard but fair</em></strong>, reflecting the stakes and severity of the situation. Every roll carries risk; otherwise, assume success and move on.</p>
<p>Damage is a solid baseline: in a fight, injuries leave you bloodied by default. Other consequences, even narrative ones, should sting just as much. There’s no strict formula — <em>it’s a gut feeling</em>. Let the fiction guide you, and make sure to give the fiction its teeth.</p>
<h3>Splitting It</h3>
<p>Breaking big consequences into smaller ones. Multiple effects can be just as effective and make more sense in the situation. You might break up bloodied into a few marks, or rattled becoming vex and rolling a pool instead. Splits make the story move in multiple directions</p>
<h3>Spreading It</h3>
<p>Hitting multiple PCs, nearby NPCs, or even a PC who didn&#39;t prompt the move. Consequences can be identical, vary in severity, or differ entirely. If a PC other than the one prompting it is hit, they get a defense roll. Spreads make the impact feel broader and pulling more people into a dynamic scene.</p>
<h3>Thinking Offscreen</h3>
<p>Fallout that happens beyond the immediate action. Not all consequences need to occur in the spotlight. Hitting elsewhere builds tension, hastens incoming trouble, or creates missed opportunities. These unseen events make the world feel alive, adding depth beyond the present moment.</p>
<h3>Using Pools</h3>
<p>Building pressure with danger or timer pools. Start or roll a danger or timer pool as another outlet for consequences, often <strong><em>offscreen</em></strong>. These create looming threats and situations the PCs want to avoid or mitigate. They build pressure and offer a strong alternative to skipping the move and banking suspense.</p>
<h3>Setting Risk</h3>
<p>Framing danger when it&#39;s not the default. Most rolls assume meaningful consequences. Declaring high risk before a roll or situation signals severe stakes—death or worse looms. Low risk shifts outcomes into lighter territory, rolling for things you&#39;d normally skip, with softer consequences. It&#39;s a tool for tone, moving between intense and light play.</p>
<h3>Taking Suspense</h3>
<p>When nothing comes to mind, skip the impact move and take suspense instead!</p>
<h2>Story Moves</h2>
<p>Keep the narrative flowing, the action engaging, and get things moving when they stall out. Player actions drive the story, and story moves nudge them forward. That doesn&#39;t mean the world is passive — you can describe anything happening that makes sense. However, from a story and gameplay perspective, it&#39;s more satisfying when the players have <strong><em>fair warning</em></strong> about trouble. They know actions have consequences and suspense you&#39;ve earned can come back to bite them. This feels fair, so outside of these you give them the initiative. It shows things aren&#39;t arbitrary — <strong><em>the GM is also playing the game, just by different rules</em></strong>.</p>
<h3>Foreshadow</h3>
<p><strong>Hint at trouble, sometimes with a timer pool. Prompts a later impact move.</strong></p>
<p><em>Foreshadow</em> to signal upcoming threats and give the players a chance to react. This is a great way to introduce adversity when you don&#39;t have or want to spend suspense. If they fail to deal with it or ignore the danger, it prompts an impact move and the pace of the story picks up.</p>
<h3>Question</h3>
<p><strong>Ask provocative questions to stir up drama or flesh out the world.</strong></p>
<p><em>Question</em> players to help suss out what kind of story they&#39;re interested in, share the creative load, and keep the story fresh for yourself. Try to keep this focused on their character&#39;s perspective, but feel free to dip into the meta channel here and talk directly as players about what you all want to see play out in game.</p>
<h3>Set The Scene</h3>
<p><strong>Use a story roll to determine how a scene starts off when it’s unclear.</strong></p>
<p><em>Set The Scene</em> when you&#39;re unsure about the specifics of the current fiction or want to dive straight into the action. Skip detailed planning and cautious leadups that often drag gameplay down. Instead, jump straight into the action, an in medias res shot of things already in motion! The roll sets the opening mood and stakes for the scene. On a grim, it can even trigger an impact move, kicking things off with a bang and raising tension right away.</p>
<h3>Spotlight</h3>
<p><strong>Focus attention on a PC, encouraging them to act or follow-up.</strong></p>
<p><em>Spotlight</em> PCs to help direct the action, ensure no one is left out, and put focus where it&#39;s needed. This prompts players towards action. Mix in cinematic language like &quot;We cut to...&quot; or &quot;The camera pans over to show...&quot; as you use the &quot;camera&quot;, your group&#39;s shared imagination space. Cut back and forth between PCs and scenes to build tension and avoid focusing on a single PC for too long.</p>
<h3>Wrap It Up</h3>
<p><strong>Call for a montage roll or jump to a likely conclusion to a scene.</strong></p>
<p><em>Wrap It Up</em> when a scene has served its purpose, grown stale, or feels like a foregone conclusion. Don&#39;t waste game time on these. Closing these scenes out decisively keeps the narrative tight and focuses on what&#39;s next.</p>
<h2>Suspense Moves</h2>
<p>Create familiar moments inspired by TV shows, incentivizing you mechanically to take the time to structure the story cinematically. <strong><em>You earn suspense</em></strong>, so they reward you for handling some of the tedium of GMing and remind players to stay engaged. Suspense keeps the world active when things stall. When your supply of suspense runs dry, you can use these to jumpstart the action again. However, use them carefully — <strong><em>overuse</em></strong> can get frustrating for players, so pick your spots. But <strong><em>timely</em></strong> use makes good, cinematic sense.</p>
<h3>Bridge</h3>
<p><strong>Resolve a problem the PCs face or use exposition to connect some dots.</strong></p>
<p><em>Bridge</em> a scene when players are stuck, backed into a corner, or a scene feels dull. It provides a quick out and moves the story forward. Normally, it would feel like an unearned freebie, the suspense you gain makes it a fair trade. Never use it when players are engaged — save it for when it&#39;s needed.</p>
<h3>Buildup</h3>
<p><strong>Give spark to each PC, who give a brief vignette before upcoming action.</strong></p>
<p><em>Buildup</em> to focus in tight on your PCs, and to create moments that set the stage for major events. These vignettes, whether a quiet campfire scene or tense moment before a battle, give players a chance to add depth and feeling to their characters that might get overlooked, and the &quot;<strong><em>free</em></strong>&quot; spark they gain lets them know that what&#39;s ahead is going to be a real challenge.</p>
<h3>Cutaway</h3>
<p><strong>Narrate an info-rich scene elsewhere, clueing the players in.</strong></p>
<p><em>Cutaway</em> to clue players in on the bigger picture, like a TV show scene. Show villains plotting, armies marching, or even positive events. It’s more fun when players know what&#39;s happening and they can steer their PCs&#39; actions toward that drama, even if their characters don&#39;t explicitly know about it.</p>
<h3>Entangle</h3>
<p><strong>Propose an interesting tangle to a PC. Take suspense only if they accept.</strong></p>
<p><em>Entangle</em> a player by proposing a juicy tangle for their PC. Push <strong><em>dilemmas</em></strong> and <strong><em>drama</em></strong> towards their traits, desires, bonds, and story arcs. The players pick them because they want the choices that come with! When you have a great idea, propose a tangle for a PC. Remember you only gain suspense if they accept, so it&#39;s up to you to make the tangle irresistible. Don&#39;t push hard — this mechanic is built to respect player agency. Don&#39;t punish for saying no.</p>
<h3>Recap</h3>
<p><strong>Summarize the last session or events further in the past.</strong></p>
<p><em>Recap</em> at the start of each session to get everyone on the same page. Hearing the last session&#39;s events builds tension for what&#39;s to come. The suspense you gain can immediately push the action, or hang over their heads. If a player wants to recap, skip taking the suspense! You can also use a mid-session <em>Recap</em> to remind players of a vital piece of information they&#39;ve forgotten.</p>
<h2>Impact Moves</h2>
<p>Deliver hard-hitting consequence that challenge PCs and push the action forward. They require prompting, so when you use them, they&#39;re sure to be justified and fair, codified into the rules. They&#39;ve had fair warning and should have an idea of the risks. So when you make a move, make sure it has <strong>IMPACT</strong> to ensure the choices leading to them matter and the world feels powerful.</p>
<p>When not prompted by a roll, impact moves directly against a PC give them a defense roll. Some talents also give the ability to interrupt impact moves, possibly negating them. If the roll to interrupt is a messy, you take suspense or keep it if you spent it to prompt the move.</p>
<h3>Complicate Things</h3>
<p><strong>Escalate a situation, introduce a new problem, or pressure a bond.</strong></p>
<p><em>Complicate Things</em> to add twists and elevate drama. Use it when things feel too stable or you want things to be even more chaotic than they already are. It&#39;s also great for adding a thorn to a roll by introducing sudden environmental obstacles, a great outlet for extra suspense that doesn&#39;t introduce new drama.</p>
<h3>Counter</h3>
<p><strong>Deny things a PC can always do or negate something they did.</strong></p>
<p><em>Counter</em> to make the world tenaciously formidable, showing that it won&#39;t just roll over. You can stop anything a PC does, including successful action rolls, talents they &quot;always&quot; have permission to use and extra vigilance. If they use a talent that costs them resources, they generally don&#39;t have to expend that resource (your call) but can&#39;t quickly use it again. However, this can never be used to stop defense rolls and criticals — don&#39;t steal their thunder. Be careful, players get frustrated if their victories and advantages are snatched away, so use it in interesting ways and make sure the spotlight works its way back to them after you take advantage of the moment.</p>
<h3>Force A Choice</h3>
<p><strong>Present tough options, with room to only choose one.</strong></p>
<p><em>Force A Choice</em> to present stark, binary decisions that they can&#39;t wiggle their way out of. This move offers no easy way out. When you use it, make sure to follow through without softening the impact. This adds a real cinematic edge, reflecting the truly difficult decisions protagonists must face.</p>
<h3>Hit &#39;Em Hard</h3>
<p><strong>Inflict damage on a PC, like bloodied, rattled, vex, marks, or a condition.</strong></p>
<p><em>Hit &#39;Em Hard</em> when you need to inflict direct consequences. Whether it’s damage, betrayal, or loss, this move underscores the seriousness of the situation. It&#39;s a heavy reminder that the world pushes back against their actions. When you use it, you should be hitting them just as hard as they&#39;re trying to hit the world.</p>
<h3>Lock It In</h3>
<p><strong>Declare something occurs, closing off immediate attempts to change it.</strong></p>
<h2><em>Lock It In</em> to definitively close off an opportunity and close out a scene that&#39;s threatening to drag on. Players can be tenacious and keep trying to find some way to not be defeated. This puts a definitive end to a situation. It makes follow-up attempts impossible, which refocuses players&#39; attention forward rather than trying to find yet another way to attempt something they&#39;ve already failed at.</h2>

<h1>Challenges</h1>
<p>Sourcebook: Grimwild</p>
<p>A framework to represent <strong><em>tasks</em></strong>, <strong><em>obstacles</em></strong>, <strong><em>enemies</em></strong>, and scenarios that have greater tenacity and complexity than a single action can accomplish. <strong>Challenges</strong> allow you to track progress towards them, but also proactively oppose the PCs. Each has <strong><em>2 bonus suspense</em></strong> to be spent on moves relating to it, and a <strong><em>task pool</em></strong> to represent its tenacity or complexity. They can also have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traits</strong>: Qualities they have with strong narrative impact, inflicting thorns, denying permissions, or changing vantage.</li>
<li><strong>Moves</strong>: Suggested impact moves they might make. These are examples, not limitations.</li>
<li><strong>Fail States</strong>: A trigger that signals the challenge failed, like a competing timer pool or a specific event. It prompts <em>Lock It In</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interpret these short, evocative phrases as fit the situation. Keep your own created challenges similarly brief and flexible. Some uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a dangerous enemy or exceptionally tough task.</li>
<li>Zoom in on pivotal moments.</li>
<li>Zoom out to collapse related tasks into one objective.</li>
<li>Turn a broad concept into an actionable objective.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Building Challenges</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Assign a task pool</em></strong> (4d, 6d, 8d) for its tenacity.</li>
<li><strong><em>Add traits</em></strong> (1 or 2) that shape the situation. Skip the obvious <em>(storm is windy)</em> and highlight what matters <em>(strong winds are blinding)</em>. Keep them brief and evocative.</li>
<li><strong><em>List short, punchy moves</em></strong> (2 or 3) with flexible interpretations. These are examples, not limits. You can spend bonus suspense on other moves, or trigger these when an impact move is prompted by something else.</li>
<li>Define a fail state, a specific trigger that prevents that challenge from being accomplished. Avoid obvious outcomes <em>(dying in a fight)</em> and focus on what creates tension <em>(breaking a code of honor)</em>. Players should know the fail state unless mystery is part of the fun — and even then, make it clear one is in play.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>Not all of these parts are needed for a challenge.</em></p>
<h2>Using Challenges</h2>
<p>Challenges are for moments of narrative importance. They make whatever you assign them to a proactive element in the story. Use them to spotlight what&#39;s happening — not because it&#39;s harder, but because it deserves proper screen time and presence. Introduce challenges at times like:</p>
<ul>
<li>An impact move is prompted.</li>
<li>You <em>Foreshadow</em> to give them fair warning.</li>
<li>You <em>Complicate Things</em> without warning.</li>
<li>The PCs head straight towards trouble on their own.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Linked Challenges</h2>
<p><strong>Linked challenges</strong> are greater, more complex interactions, like epicly powerful enemies or unbelievably tense social situations. Each part of the whole has its own proactive presence in the scene. Give them traits that prompt impact moves, triggered by the fiction for dynamic interactions.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>8d | <em>Boss Guy</em> | 2 suspense</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Traits</strong>: <em>Ruthless</em></li>
<li><strong>Moves</strong>: <em>Big Weapon</em>, <em>Command Subordinates</em></li>
<li><strong>Fail States</strong>:<ul>
<li><em>He Gets What He Wants</em></li>
</ul>

<h1>Vigilance</h1>
<p>Sourcebook: Grimwild</p>
<p>The assumed alertness of the PCs, avoiding overly cautious gameplay to keep the focus on the action.</p>
<p><strong><em>PCs are always considered to be as vigilant as their vantage allows</em></strong> when dealing with hidden dangers like <em>traps</em>, <em>lies</em>, or <em>secret doors</em>. However, this doesn&#39;t mean they are always aware of hidden threats. Instead, the GM uses a gut feeling to decide how much the PC perceives based on their vantage and the type of tension the GM wants to build.</p>
<p>Each of the three levels of vigilance creates a different dynamic in the scene, a different view of PC competence and the danger of the world. These three levels are: <strong>hint</strong>, <strong>reveal</strong>, and <strong>strike</strong>.</p>
<h2>Hint</h2>
<p><em>Foreshadow</em> with a subtle clue about a hidden element. <strong><em>The player</em></strong> gets a single chance to interpret the situation. They&#39;re limited to just one to highlight the natural response of the PC and to keep things flowing. <strong><em>Player intuition guides the story forward.</em></strong> A correct response leads to a reveal or possibly bypasses the situation entirely.</p>
<h2>Reveal</h2>
<p><em>Foreshadow</em> with an obvious unveiling of an immediately imminent threat. <strong><em>The PC</em></strong> that becomes aware has one chance to react before the danger strikes. <strong><em>Character competence guides the story forward.</em></strong></p>
<h2>Strike</h2>
<h2>Make an impact move as the danger immediately strikes them. <strong><em>The GM</em></strong> assumes the PCs were not vigilant enough. <strong><em>The dangerous world guides the story forward.</em></strong></h2>

<h1>Factions</h1>
<p>Sourcebook: Grimwild</p>
<p>Track off-screen developments of major forces, creating a feeling of a living world beyond the PCs. They have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resources</strong> that show their power and influence, like assets, traits and relationships.</li>
<li><strong>Goals</strong> that show their ambitions. Track each with a timer called a <strong>faction pool</strong>, rolled between sessions or when triggered by events in the story.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a faction pool depletes, the goal is either accomplished or they make their move against another faction, with a story roll in their favor determining how it plays out.</p>
<p>Keep 4-6 active factions, balancing major and minor ones, with competing goals. Replace factions that are no longer relevant to the story.</p>
<h2>Campaign Pools</h2>
<p>Timers that pace long-term events across sessions. They work like faction pools but don’t require faction details. Use them to signal upcoming events or remind you to reintroduce plotlines.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Faction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resources</strong>: <em>Leadership, Money, Assets</em></li>
<li><strong>Goals</strong>: <em>4d Get Thing, 6d Do Thing</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Campaign Pool</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resources</strong>: <em>Stuff That Makes Things Happen</em></li>

<h1>GM With Moxie</h1>
<p>Sourcebook: Grimwild</p>
<h2>Map Fiction To Rules</h2>
<p>Encourage players to focus on the fiction and let you handle the rules. The more narratively important something is, the more mechanical weight you should give it.</p>
<p>Get creative applying the rules, mixing them up in ways not explicitly laid out. Don&#39;t be afraid to tinker. Moxie is modular and you&#39;re not going to break it. Graft on rules from other systems you like, or hack Moxie and make it your own.</p>
<p>If the rules clash with what makes sense in the fiction, the fiction wins. Engage with the rules quickly, resolve them, and return to the story.</p>
<h2>Make Rulings To Fill Gaps</h2>
<p>The rules are a flexible framework and designed not to cover every detail. When things fall through the cracks, try to interpret the rules&#39; intent and make a ruling that fits the moment. If it&#39;s a judgment call, tell the players. If you&#39;re unsure of a rule, make a quick call now and check later. When in doubt, everything can collapse down to a single story roll — ask the players what they want to happen, then roll to see if that&#39;s how it goes down.</p>
<h2>Pace The Game Cinematically</h2>
<p>Keep the game flowing like a well-paced movie. Don&#39;t let scenes drag, wrap it up to move on to something more interesting. If players don&#39;t seem keen on an upcoming situation, suggest a montage. Skip long planning phases by cutting to the action with a <em>Set the Scene</em> move. Reward players buying into these techniques by giving them good odds.</p>
<h2>Follow The Players&#39; Lead</h2>
<p>Keep tabs on story arcs and present drama, dilemmas, and opportunities related to them. Follow where the characters want to go. Present interesting situations related to it. When players hesitate or hit an impasse, spur them into action with danger timers, quarrels, <em>Entangles</em>, or <em>Bridge</em> and move on.</p>
<h2>Use The Moves, Or Don&#39;t</h2>
<p>The GM moves can be explicit rules, merely guidelines, or somewhere in between. Some GMs will call them out by name, while others never bring them up at all. Either way, as long as your GMing aligns with their intent, you&#39;re doing it right.</p>
<h2>Make Moves With Impact</h2>
<p>Don&#39;t pull your punches — impact moves are called that for a reason. They shove the story forward. Players have a lot of tools at their disposal, so <strong><em>give the world teeth</em></strong>. It makes victory even sweeter.</p>
<p>A single impact move is flexible. You can split it up into a few lesser effects, hit multiple PCs at once, or have a PC&#39;s action affect a totally different PC, though they do get a defense roll in that case.</p>
<p>When an impact move doesn&#39;t naturally flow from what&#39;s happening on-screen (<em>common with messy rolls</em>), think off-screen instead and complicate their lives elsewhere or take suspense and hit later with better dramatic timing.</p>
<h2>Prompt Player Narration</h2>
<p>After a roll, make sure the players narrate how things play out — even, or especially, on a grim. Describing failure is a great way to express their character. Collaborate, but keep them narrating their actions.</p>
<p>Encourage them to play off of each other as well, especially with assists and montages. Ask for reaction shots as other PCs&#39; scenes play out to gauge how they feel about it, or how their bond affects their reaction.</p>
<p>Most importantly, after the rules come into play, get right back to narration. Make sure that the flow remains <strong><em>fiction, to rules, to fiction</em></strong>.</p>
<h2>Be Endlessly Curious</h2>
<p>Ask provocative questions about the PCs and their motivations to give players a chance to expand on their characters.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Why in the world would you do that?</em></li>
<li><em>Okay, so who&#39;d you steal that from?</em></li>
<li><em>So are you pissed off or cool with it?</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Running Combat</h2>
<p>When a fight breaks out, the action flows naturally, following the spotlight. There are no specific rules that differentiate combat from any other scene.</p>
<p><strong><em>There&#39;s no turn order.</em></strong> The GM describes the impending danger in the current situation and asks how the PCs respond, or the PCs take action on their own. The spotlight is often on the PCs, and the world&#39;s actions flow from what they do. You make enemies more proactive by <em>Foreshadowing</em> events and following up after, or spending suspense to make impact moves. This results in a cinematic ebb and flow to combat.</p>
<p><strong><em>Battles occur in the theater of the mind</em></strong>, using the
group&#39;s shared imagination to keep track of each participant&#39;s fictional positioning to map fiction to rules. However, using <strong><em>battlemaps</em></strong> or sketching maps with minis or markers to track locations during a fight works well, too. This helps organize the chaotic situation, makes sure everyone gets time to shine, and keeps everyone&#39;s imagination aligned. Don&#39;t get caught up in detailed tracking — update the map with big changes.</p>
<h3>Combat Rulings</h3>
<p>You map the fiction to the rules just like any scene, making rulings to fill in gaps. However, in combat you&#39;ll often see the same scenarios come up, so for the sake of consistency, some common rulings:</p>
<p><strong>Movement</strong>: Moving usually accompanies another action — the goal isn&#39;t just to get somewhere, but to get there and do something. If an interesting obstacle blocks the way, it needs an action roll.</p>
<p><strong>Weapons</strong>: Compare the weapons in play and use common sense to resolve any issues. Most weapons are evenly matched; the roll only shifts if there&#39;s a clear imbalance.</p>
<p><strong>Melee combat</strong>: Most melee attacks use Brawn, while light, fast weapons rely on Agility. Dirty tricks call for Wits, but rarely work more than once.</p>
<p><strong>Ranged combat</strong>: Precision attacks roll Agility, while thrown weapons use Brawn or Agility based on weight and range. Charging an enemy with ranged weapons is reckless, adding +1t or requiring a separate action to close the gap.</p>
<p><strong>Defense Rolls</strong>: The GM selects the stat to test. Melee attacks are dodged with Agility, blocked with Brawn (using armor or shields), anticipated with Wits, or keeping your nerve with Presence.</p>
<p><strong>Armor</strong>: Armor and shields are represented by talents. Otherwise, they are vantage and set dressing for defense rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Vulnerabilities</strong>: Exploiting a vulnerability can lower thorns, drop 1 before rolling a pool, or even bypass the need for a roll. In some cases, finding a vulnerability is required to attack at all.</p>
<h2><strong>Ranged vs. Melee</strong>: Precise ranged attacks demand focus, which is tough with nearby threats. Inflict +1t to these rolls when under immediate danger.</h2>

<h1>Spellcasting</h1>
<p>Sourcebook: Grimwild</p>
<p><strong>Spellcasting</strong> is the ability to harness magic, acquired through talents or arcana. While each style has its quirks, they all follow the same <em>laws of magic</em>. Spells are cast using <strong>touchstones</strong> — key terms like spell names, godly domains, or item descriptions. You interpret these on-the-fly, defining the permissions and limitations of your magic when you cast. Each source clearly defines its touchstones, casting methods, and costs.</p>
<p>Magic has four magnitudes: <strong>cantrips</strong>, <strong>spells</strong>, <strong>potent spells</strong>, and <strong>rituals</strong>. Determine the magic&#39;s magnitude by comparing:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong><em>final result</em></strong>, not the method, to what can be achieved by a non-magic action roll.</li>
<li>The <strong><em>narrative impact</em></strong>, not the result, to the impact of a normal action roll.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Final result</strong> is used to judge most cases, seeing if the magic is replicating what can be done through non-magic means. The second is then used when the first isn&#39;t possible.</p>
<p><strong>Narrative impact</strong> is used to judge spellcasting results without mundane equivalents, to ensure that magic and non-magic means have the same overall impact on the story.</p>
<p>The GM uses the guideline and examples on these pages to set the line between spells and potent spells, as well as the upper limit — beyond extraordinary magic (+4t), only accomplishable with rituals. This is a judgment call set through play, so transparency and consistency are key.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cantrips</strong> are similar to something that doesn&#39;t require a roll. They should feel <strong><em>flavorful</em></strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Spells</strong> are similar to an action roll, impactful but not dominating a scene. They should feel <strong><em>useful</em></strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Potent spells</strong> are similar to a group effort, effort over time, or a single effort with potency. They should feel <strong><em>powerful</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cantrips</h2>
<p><strong>Cantrips</strong> are <em>set dressing</em>, minor effects that don&#39;t require rolls. Success is automatic.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cantrip utility</em></strong> lets you flavor other action rolls with cantrips, or even use them to replace gear when using relevant touchstones. This reasonably expands vantage. You roll the stat you&#39;d normally roll for the now-possible action, like Brawn or Agility to swing a conjured sword.</p>
<h2>Spells</h2>
<p><strong>Spells</strong> have effects equal to an action roll, results one person with the right training and tools can achieve. They&#39;re the baseline magnitude of magic</p>
<h2>Potent Spells</h2>
<p><strong><em>Potent spells</em></strong> accomplish more than a normal spell — <strong><em>they give potency and broaden vantage</em></strong>. A potent spell can achieve effects equal to an entire group working together, as with normal potency. You can attempt <em>jaw-dropping</em> effects (+3t/difficulty). A normally +1t or +2t task has <em>greater effect</em> (critical bonus), and a +0t roll is automatic.</p>
<h2>Touchstones</h2>
<p>Spellcasting ability comes with touchstones and all magic effects must logically align with them, making sense and feeling natural. If it feels like a <em>reach</em>, it’s beyond the touchstone’s bounds.</p>
<p><strong><em>The GM can veto spells that don&#39;t align with your touchstones</em></strong>. They can also instead allow it, but inflict a thorn or collateral effects when it&#39;s pushing your touchstones, but not <em>completely</em> implausible.</p>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>When you take a magic talent, have a discussion with the GM about what your magic can and can&#39;t do. Clearly defining it in this way makes the magic more fun to play with - <strong><em>creativity thrives within limitations</em></strong>. If a PC&#39;s magic feels too broad during the campaign, consider discussing new limitations to keep it balanced and engaging.</p>
<h2>Spellcasting Rulings</h2>
<p>Spellcasting&#39;s a freeform system, built on flexibility and creative rulings from the GM, with the understanding that its freedom is meant to preserve the feeling of magic. While this system can be exploited in unfun ways aimed at &quot;winning,&quot; it relies on you buying into your magic touchstones and the magnitudes of magic. <strong><em>Don&#39;t be a weasel</em></strong> — play in good faith and have fun with the freedom it gives you. With that in mind, here are some common rulings for various situations involving magic:</p>
<h3>Magic Trappings</h3>
<p>Discuss with the GM how your casting appears, its visual style, movements you make, and tools you use. All magic is clear and evident — trying to hide it is extremely difficult at best, but usually impossible. Losing implements or being hindered can deny permission to cast or inflict thorns.</p>
<h3>Magic On Defense Rolls</h3>
<p>The GM chooses the stat for defense rolls, and can choose to let you use spellcasting. This counts as set dressing and doesn&#39;t cost a resource, like dice dropped from a pool. If the GM calls for another stat, but you have a clear spell-based counter, you can ask them if you have time to cast a spell instead. This is a spell as usual and it&#39;s the GM&#39;s choice if you have time.</p>
<h3>Assisting With Magic</h3>
<p>Using magic to assist a roll is just <em>set dressing</em> with no cost — just keep the narration reasonable <em>(the weaker end of a spell)</em>. Remember you&#39;re assisting. If you&#39;re making the action roll on a group level, cast as usual.</p>
<h3>Detecting Magic</h3>
<p>With a relevant touchstone, you can recognize magic easily. Without one, it&#39;s harder, though magic ability counts as a factor. Without training, the magic must be very obvious to be noticed.</p>
<h3>Dispelling Magic</h3>
<p>Anyone aware that something is magic can try to dispel it. This does not require training—you can cast a spell with relevant touchstones that counters it, cause enough of a disturbance to it, or outsmarting the magic&#39;s logic in some way. Creativity should be rewarded here.</p>
<h3>Healing Magic</h3>
<p>Spells can clear marks, heal minor conditions or immediate conditions <em>(4d bleeding out)</em>, or calm a vex response. Potent spells can pull off +3t/impossible healing, such as roll a healing pool <em>(bloodied, rattled)</em> or mending broken bones <em>(but not a severed arm)</em>. Rituals are needed for things like regrowing limbs, curing blindness, or removing deep trauma.</p>
<h3>Resurrection</h3>
<p>Bringing back the dead is a costly, extremely risky ritual rarely worth the price you&#39;ll surely have to pay. Tread carefully.</p>
<h3>Buffs And Debuffs</h3>
<p>Spells that help or hinder are considered on a case-by-case basis, with the player and GM working together. As a starting point, a buff can apply the effects of a <strong><em>critical</em></strong>: <em>greater effect — secondary effect — setup</em>. Debuffs can do the same against anyone working against the foe. They can also add vantage. Potent buffs might last longer, affect multiple targets, make +0t rolls automatically successful, or allow for a potent feat. Get creative with applying the mechanics and capture the feeling the spell is going for.</p>
<h3>Magic Duration</h3>
<p>As a rule of thumb, a spell lasts just a moment, maybe two, and a potent spell lasts for a scene. This is judged by the GM based on the intended effect, which you balance against the magnitude of spell.</p>
<h3>Potions</h3>
<p>Magical items, like potions, that allow you to use them as tools require an action to apply, such as rolling Agility to throw and hit someone with a potion. The efficacy of a potion is usually automatic, based on what tier of potion it is, but you can make a story roll if it&#39;s unclear. The more powerful the potion, the more dice you roll for the story roll.</p>
<h3>Casters vs Melee</h3>
<p>In combat, spellcasting works as a precise ranged attack, demanding focus, which is tough with nearby threats. Inflict +1t to these rolls when under immediate danger.</p>
<h3>Enemy Magic</h3>
<p>Enemy magic doesn&#39;t follow the same rules as PC magic. It manifests through GM moves and is constrained only by the fiction.</p>
<h2>Rituals</h2>
<p><strong>Rituals</strong> can accomplish magical effects far beyond what can be done with even potent spells, equal to the labor of an entire team of people over an extended period, effects that can have significant impact on the world, or push the very limits of implausibility. <strong>Casting a ritual consists of 3 parts</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Possess a <strong>source</strong> of magic with relevant touchstones.</li>
<li><strong>Anchor</strong> the ritual to the physical and metaphysical realms.</li>
<li>Complete the ritual&#39;s <strong>rites</strong> to finalize its casting.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Source of magic</strong> can be a spellcasting talent or a scroll, potion, or other arcana. It might also be something creative like asking or tricking a monster into helping. Even a PC without magic ability can initiate a ritual as long as they have a source of magic.</p>
<p><strong>Anchors</strong> for a ritual are chosen by the GM and players together. They should feel connected to the ritual&#39;s touchstones and intent, and match the intended impact of the ritual. <strong><em>Two or three anchors</em></strong>, like an <em>enchanted location</em>, some <em>exotic ingredients</em> or <em>auspicious timing</em>, are best.</p>
<h2><strong>Rites</strong> are the act of casting the ritual, a challenge that must be overcome, made far more difficult or even impossible if any of the anchors are missing.</h2>

<h1>Treasure</h1>
<p>Sourcebook: Grimwild</p>
<p>Treasure is the currency of an adventurer, useful in trade with the powerful entities in the world to further your own aims. Your skills put you beyond worrying about the expenses of daily life and adventuring gear.</p>
<p>You deal in treasures — <strong><em>minor</em></strong>, <strong><em>major</em></strong>, and <strong><em>mythic</em></strong>, anything from a stash of gold to a rare artifact or magical item. While the treasure&#39;s label gives some indication of its value and the table below shows what you might get for it in trade, a treasure is only truly as valuable as what someone will give you for it.</p>
<p>Treasures are shared by the party, unless chosen otherwise. With each adventure, it&#39;s assumed that you&#39;re gaining some coin to spend on your own. Treasures are the things beyond that, valuable resources the party can leverage.</p>
<p>Hauling treasure isn&#39;t a problem unless the GM specifically makes it one. You can also assume that when a PC needs one of the party&#39;s treasures, they happen to have it on them if it makes sense. That is, unless the GM <em>Complicates Things</em> (a <strong>move</strong>).</p>

<h2>Finding Treasure</h2>
<p>When you gain treasure, the GM can either specify what it is or just give its tier and handwave it. If you want specifics on it later or it becomes important to the story, figure it out then. It&#39;s the GM&#39;s job to match up treasure and the nature of the adventure and campaign. When unsure about what exactly is found, they can use a story roll or GM crucible to help.</p>
<h2>Carousing</h2>
<p>Any time you&#39;re in a settlement, you can carouse by selling off a minor treasure, with each PC spending their leisure time as they like. Make a montage roll and narrate — or suffer — the results. After the scenes finish up, everyone takes spark regardless of the roll.</p>
<h2>Arcana</h2>
<p>Arcana are <em>rare artifacts of power</em>, magic imbued in them through ritual or other esoteric forces. They grant <strong><em>vantage</em></strong>, letting you do what&#39;s otherwise impossible, or greatly enhance specific tasks by granting outside assistance, at a cost. Some create strange, unique effects tied to their creator&#39;s intent. As always, it&#39;s the GM&#39;s role to map fiction to rules for each arcana. Arcana have the same tiers as treasure: <strong><em>minor</em></strong>, <strong><em>major</em></strong>, and <strong><em>mythic</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>An arcana&#39;s name and description serve as its touchstones</strong>, while its tier reflects the magnitude of magic bound to it. Unlike the rigid <em>laws of magic</em> governing PC magic, guidelines for arcana are looser, typically following this pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Minor arcana</em></strong> have <em>cantrip</em> to <em>spell</em>-level effects.</li>
<li><strong><em>Major arcana</em></strong> have <em>spell</em> to <em>potent spell</em>-level effects.</li>
<li><strong><em>Mythic arcana</em></strong> have <em>ritual</em>-level effects.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Designing Arcana</h3>
<p>Arcana are generally tools for the GM, crafted to fit the campaign. The <strong>GM Crucible</strong> is a great source of inspiration for designing them.</p>
<p>Arcana are what they are—they&#39;re truths within the fiction. They can do what their description says. A shortcut to creating one works like this, though. Start with an evocative name and a single touchstone word, then apply one or two Sorcery techniques: <em>attack — creation — defense — enhancement — hindrance — influence — transformation — traversal</em>. From that, you can build out the description. Or begin with the description and work backwards towards defining the touchstones.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Activation</strong>: Requires spending spark, pushing yourself, or another resource to activate.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Usage</strong>: Has a resource or power pool, usually 4d. At 0d, it must be recharged by satisfying a specific anchor, like a ritual.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Arcana Rulings</h2>
<p>Arcana are as flexible as spellcasting — if not more so — and demand just as much creativity and GM rulings when used. Here are some examples:</p>
<h3>Wands And Similar</h3>
<p>Bestow spellcasting ability on those wielding them. They have limited usage, a power pool rolled to cast from them. They don&#39;t require training to use.</p>
<h3>Potions And Similar</h3>
<p>Potions have a magnitude one level higher than its tier. A <em>Minor Healing Potion</em> can accomplish what a spell can (heal a mark). <em>Major potions</em> are potent spell effects and <em>Mythic potions</em> are ritual-level effects.</p>
<h3>Scrolls</h3>
<p>Single-use arcana that match the tier of their effects, unlike other consumables. Lacking vantage to cast spells means you take thorns casting from them. Scrolls are also highly sought after for learning spells with the wizard&#39;s Spellcraft talent.</p>
<h3>Crafting Arcana</h3>
<p>The act of binding magic to items requires a ritual and a source of magic with the proper touchstones to make it. A ritual of creation generally takes far longer, though is often less dangerous, than merely achieving the same effect through a ritual.</p>
<h3>Purchasing Arcana</h3>
<p>Prices depend entirely on the seller&#39;s desires, usually something other than coin. Finding one for sale is exceedingly rare, but you might locate someone willing to craft it for you for the right price.</p>
