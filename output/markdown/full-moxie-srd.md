# Goals Of The SRD
Sourcebook: Unknown

For starters, what's the point of an SRD? As the name implies, it is reference material. Thus, making it **easy to reference** is an obvious goal.

Additionally, Moxie is a **modular system** - easy to get stuff in and out. This aspect should be preserved.

Finally, it should be as **consistent** as possible with other Moxie projects - by using the same conventions, for instance.

## Conventions

As per **Grimwild, Chapter 1: Getting Started**:

- **Dice Notation**: The SRD uses standard dice notation in the format of "AdX". "A" is omitted if 1.
- **System Terms**: Are **bolded** only when first introduced or when clarity is needed. Emphasis is show with _italics_, sometimes **_boldly_**.
- **Pools**: Refer, specifically, to **diminishing pools**.
- **PC**: Refer, specifically, to **player characters**. Used interchangeably with "character".
- **D66 Tables**: 6x6 random tables, roll 2d6 and use one die for each row or column, your choice of which.
- **Crucibles**: d66 tables of words that are meant to be mashed together for inspiration.
- **Pronouns**: The SRD addresses the reader as "you". When employing the third person, "they" is used. "I" and "We" are only used in examples - keep authorial voice to a minimum.

# Playing With Moxie
Sourcebook: Grimwild



The _Moxie_ ruleset is designed for **cinematic gameplay**. The heart of that is **_narrative collaboration_**. It's all about creating a _shared imagination space, managing the spotlight, and diving into narration_. The rules will get you halfway there — they're all pointing towards keeping the pace flowing quickly and the action dramatic. The other half is in your hands, the players at the table, and the attitude you all approach the game with.

## Play Cinematically

**_Trust in the collaborative process._** Everyone at the table adds details into the story. You have to work together and play off of each other or the game, and the story you're telling, will fall flat.

**_Use the camera, your shared imagination._** Each player has two perspectives, from your character and as the audience watching this TV show. Use the camera and vivid description to paint a cool scene in everyone's mind.

**_Tell us what it looks like, before and after your rolls._** Give details about what you do, don’t just leave it at broad statements. Zoom in and out. Use the camera to show things outside of your own character as well — pan around, cut to other scenes, and describe NPCs. Invoke cinematic vibes and create great scenes.

## Play In Good Faith

**_Don’t be a weasel._** Do what your character would do, then let the GM map it back to the rules. Don’t overdo it trying to work your way into better rolls. The fun is letting the story flow naturally. When you ask the rules what happens next, follow where it points with enthusiasm.

**_Separate player and character knowledge._** It’s more fun when everyone knows what’s going on in the game. Don’t keep secrets from each other, keep them from characters. As a player, be aware of what your character knows and doesn’t know and play towards both.

**_Use the meta-channel sparingly._** This is conversation about the game between players. It’s unavoidable, but minimize it to keep that shared imagination in sync at the table. For anything longer than a quick question, call for a pause to talk things through, a clean break point to resume from later.



**_Know the rules._** When playing a game Made With Moxie, you can always take a look at this SRD for a refresher. The rules say a lot about the types of stories to be told with the game, and the less time you spend talking about the rules, the more time you have for roleplaying. Making a cheat sheet on rules you often forget can be a big help, or even just skimming the books you're using pre-game.

## Play To Tell A Story

Think of the game as a series of improv prompts, posed by yourselves and the rules. When you respond to them, consider the following:

- _What would my character do?_
- _What would make for a cool scene?_
- _What would move the story forward?_
- _What opens the door to get others involved?_

**_Don’t talk yourself out of fun._** The first idea that jumps into your head is often the one you should go with. Don’t overthink or rationalize yourself out of it. Like any great TV show character, go where the fun lies. Great stories involve excitement, danger, and hard choices.

**_Open doors and step through them._** The best scenes involve characters playing off of each other, so make chances for others to get involved. When someone invites you into a scene, step through that door — even if it means a bit of mental gymnastics to justify your character’s actions. And as long as you step through the door at times, remember that it can be just as interesting to close the door instead.

**_Work the spotlight._** There’s no turn order of any kind, but there is screen time. Strive to make sure everyone gets their fair share, including yourself.

- **Grab the spotlight** when there's a lull or you have a great idea.
- **Share the spotlight** by opening doors or following up on another PC's actions.
- **Pass the spotlight** when you've been holding it too long.
- **Point the spotlight** to see another PC's response or what they've been up to.
- **Never steal the spotlight.** Everyone works hard to set up their moment.

**_Don't play to win, play to tell stories._** Work towards the same goal — to tell a great story where everyone's PC has a chance to grow. Failure isn't losing, it's just another opportunity to have a great scene. Of course, your character wants to succeed! However, your goal as a player is keeping the story interesting. Play into the bad luck just as you do the good to help ensure you craft compelling stories.

## Play Characters That Grow

**_Leave lots of blank space._** Your PC starts with a past and connections to the world, but it's best as latticework. Learn who they are through play. Leave space for the other PCs and story to fit in.

**_Don’t be afraid to change._** PCs often go through hell. Any dramatic story has adversity. Let what happens change who they are. Announce what your PC's thinking, especially big shifts. If nobody else at the table knows, it’s not really happening in that shared imagination.

**_Don’t be afraid to stay the same._** Some aspects of your character might be immutable. That’s also part of what makes a great character. There can be those things they will stick to, even to the bitter end. Just make sure it’s worth it, and fun. Don’t die on small hills — die on entertaining ones.

**_Make time for smaller moments._** Quiet time, a conversation about nothing, introspection, reflection — these make for great scenes to flesh out your characters and the world. Don't just rush from action scene to action scene.

**_Most importantly, do stuff!_** Find reasons to get into the spotlight, push story arcs forward, and make fun scenes. When there's no opportunity, add some details to the story to create one!

# Core Rules
Sourcebook: Grimwild

## Core Mechanic

When things get _risky_ and _dramatic_, roll to see what happens. Grab a few d6 dice (_d_) equal to the stat the GM picks to test, roll them, and take the highest to determine the **outcome** - 6: **Perfect**, 4-5: **Messy**, 1-3: **Grim**.

- A **critical** happens when you roll two or more 6s. **_Ignore any cuts_** and choose a **critical bonus**: _greater effect_ - _secondary effect_ - _setup a follow up_.
- A **disaster** happens when a grim is cut by a **thorn**. Whatever the risk was before, _double it_ - the worst case scenario comes to pass.

## Thorns

One or two d8s (_t_) added to your roll by the GM to reflect a tougher than normal task. Each 7 or 8 on a thorn **cuts** a roll's outcome by one step - perfect becomes messy, messy becomes grim, grim becomes a disaster.

A normal roll is +0t/_tough_. The GM adds thorns with their _gut feeling_, given the situation. They can make it +1t/_very tough_ or +2t/_extremely tough_. If it's at +3t, the task can't be done - break it up into steps or try a new approach.

If needed, the GM can assess difficulty factors to determine how many thorns to add:

- **Intrinsic**: Scale, opposing skill, numbers...
- **External**: Environment, training, tools...
- **Intangible**: Strong feelings, bad information, a curse...

**Damage** to a PC also adds thorns to a roll, but they don't count towards making it _impossible_.

## Smooth Flow

If a grim threatens to grind the story to a halt, the GM can **keep things moving** - you get what you want, but in a way that makes things much worse. If a roll somehow turns out to have no effect, you learn new info or setup for a follow up.

# Working Together
Sourcebook: Grimwild

## Assist

You help another PC on a roll. State **how & why**, then **_roll 1d and share the risk_**. Include your roll result with theirs for the final outcome - then each narrate your contribution, using your result and bonds as a guide.

**_You can assist when another PC's actions prompts an impact move._** You make a 1d defense roll for them.

When you **share the risk**, you open yourself up to the consequences, which can prompt a more powerful or additional impact move, or the GM can take suspense instead.

## Teamwork

When 3+ PCs work together, the GM picks who rolls the action - sometimes the most skilled, sometimes the least. The other PCs assist.

## Setup

When a previous action makes a follow-up more effective, you assist without risk. You roll 1d as a normal assist, but don't share the risk.

## Outside Assistance

When an assist or setup comes from the world, like an NPC or the environment, **_the GM Rolls 1d_** to represent it.

# Dice Rolls
Sourcebook: Grimwild

## Action Roll

Roll to pull off something risky. State **how & why**, clarifying your intent. The GM picks the stat that matches your intentions.

- **Perfect**: You do it, and avoid trouble.
- **Messy**: You do it, but there's trouble. _Prompts an impact move_.
- **Grim**: You fail, and there's trouble. _Prompts an impact move_.

The GM makes an impact move to introduce consequences. You don't get a defense roll against impact moves prompted by your own action rolls - avoiding danger is already factored into the roll.

## Defense Roll

Roll to avoid incoming trouble, **_but only when not caused by your own action_**. The GM calls for the roll and picks a stat to test.

- **Perfect**: You avoid the trouble.
- **Messy**: You avoid the brunt of the trouble. _The GM lightens the consequences_.
- **Grim**: You fail to avoid trouble. _The GM follows through on the move_.

The GM calls for defense rolls when they target you directly with an impact move. On a messy, there's still some trouble, like taking lesser damage, losing the chance to act, or being in a worse position.

**_Defense is cinematic - a reaction, out of your hands_**. The GM picks the stat to fit the danger, your PC's likely reaction, vulnerabilities, and what feels right for the moment. This keeps it varied - you can't always use a strong stat.

## Montage Roll

Roll to condense a sequence you don't want to play out in detail, but still want to leave up to the dice. **_Roll 2d_**, resolving it all as a single action roll, then narrate a few beats. Keep things moving or zoom in on a grim.

If multiple PCs join, **_each rolls 2d and shares the risk_**. Collaborate on the results. 6s on separate rolls don't count towards criticals.

# Diminishing Pools
Sourcebook: Grimwild

## Pools

A set of d6s used to track things like time, resources, or effort. When triggered, roll the pool and **drop** 1d for each 1-3 result. At 0d, the pool depletes and the fiction changes.

The size of a pool is **4d**/_short_, **6d**/_mid_, or **8d**/_long_. At **0d**, an event occurs, a situation ends, or a resource is depleted. Make sure to reflect the fiction - if a pool and the fiction don't match up, adjust or scrap the pool.

- If no dice are dropped from a task pool on a messy or perfect action roll, instead take a **secondary effect**. If the roll was only 1d, you can instead **push yourself** to drop the last die. In similar cases, the GM can **spend suspense** to drop the last die.

- **Drop** 1d from the pool before rolling it when a talent tells you to do so or you take the _greater effect_ critical bonus. This stacks.

Pools can be flexibly applied in many situations, usually by the GM. Some typical pools are listed below.

**_Note_**: _Pools are always notated with the size of the pool in front of it, usually written in italics_.

### Timer Pools

Events unfolding in the background. Roll during key moments, when time passes, or a after few PCs take action.

### Danger Pools

Threats becoming more likely. Roll during impact moves, major events or to increase threat level.

### Task Pools

Effort to overcome tasks. Roll when progress is made in the task, usually an action roll.

### Resource Pools

Quantity of something precious. Roll when the resource sees significant usage.

# Narrative Weight
Sourcebook: Grimwild

## Vantage

Your character's frame of reference, the sum of their backstory, talents, and the current fiction - everything on your sheet and what's affecting you in the story. When a question arises about what you can do, have, or know, check it against your vantage: does it feel like a **_given_**, a **_stretch_** or a **_reach_**?.

**Proper vantage** opens up possibilities and gives the freedom to declare story details. Lacking it makes things more difficult, or even impossible.

## Tools Of The Trade

You're assumed to have the gear and skills that are a given for your vantage. This avoids detailed tracking and ensures PCs are competent where it makes sense.

## Details

Use the details on your sheet as creative inspiration - _and limitations!_ - for roleplaying. They are player (_not GM_) tools. When unsure of your PC's actions or thoughts, play towards or even against a relevant detail. Update details as the story unfolds, announcing the change and giving a vignette to _give it weight_ and _clearly convey_ the change to the other players.

# Character Details
Sourcebook: Grimwild

## Background

Your heritage, upbringing, and profession - the core of your vantage. You choose any two that most influences who you are now. Each gives you three wises, evocative key phrases that clearly expand your vantage.

## Traits

Choose 2 that strongly define you and 1 that definitely doesn't.

## Desires

Choose 2 that you strongly desire and 1 that you don't at all.

## Features

Detail your 3 most distinctive, outward features that others quickly notice.

## Talents

Special advantages and abilities that set your PC apart. At character creation, you choose a **path**, which gives you its core talent and a list of talents that align thematically with it. You gain new talents as you level, choosing from your path list or taking talents from other paths.

The path name is simply a label for organizing talents thematically. On its own, it doesn't expand vantage. However, talents to expand vantage.

## Stats

Your core capabilities rated from 1/_poor_ to 3/_great_, used for action and defense rolls.

**Brawn** is _power, menace, toughness_.
**Agility** is _precision, athletics, reflexes_.
**Wits** are _smarts, trickery, reading situations_.
**Presence** is _influence, willpower, reading people_.

- Brawn and Agility are paired **physical stats**.
- Wits and Presence are paired **mental stats**.

## Bonds

Your dynamic with each PC. Match an intensity and a nature below, or write your own. Interpret as makes sense.

| Intensity | Nature      |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Deep      | Affection   |
| Complex   | Camaraderie |
| Growing   | Curiosity   |
| Lowkey    | Doubts      |
| Playful   | Respect     |
| Tense     | Rivalry     |

Bonds are your strongest view of the other PC, and not necessarily reciprocal. You can change a bond anytime, such as in response to something they've done or something new you've learned about them. When it changes, give a short vignette. **_The other PC takes spark_**.

# Creative Freedom
Sourcebook: Grimwild

## Set Dressing

Add minor, common sense details freely. Make assumptions and add _set dressing_ to scenes to play off of to keep things flowing dynamically. There's no need to check in with the GM - they'll step in if a detail goes beyond set dressing. Anything that's a _given_ for your vantage, like knowing someone or having equipment that makes sense, is set dressing.

## Tangles

Character-driven complications you introduce into a scene and have to follow-up on. In return, you take spark. Tangles must stem from your vantage or story arcs nad always have an immediate impact, like an action roll, an option closing off, or forcing inaction at an important moment. These are things like:

- **_Unwise decisions_** your PC would likely make.
- **_Personal motivations_** over group goals.
- **_Complications_** from beliefs or backstory.

## Story

_Pure cinematic momentum_. Each session you have **2 story**. Spend it to add **_story details_** that go beyond set dressing, creating new opportunities or shifting the scene in your favor. Added details must fit your vantage, _at least as a stretch_, or tie to a story arc. Example details:

- **_Character_**: Gear, contacts, backstory...
- **_Scene_**: NPC actions, objects, atmospherics...
- **_Setting_**: History, geography, factions...

Added details can't override rolls or contradict the established story. If your detail affects another PC, get permission. The GM can make a story roll to see how true or beneficial it is, or add nuance. On a grim, it may backfire! The GM can also veto details to keep things coherent.

There are _gray zones_ between set dressing, story details, and details simply too impactful to add. Set boundaries with your group.

# Story Arcs
Sourcebook: Grimwild

Evocative phrases that give your PC and group a thematic direction. Find out where they lead through play - they're a starting direction, not the destination.

Pick a **group arc** together, then a **character arc**. Pick from the examples or write your own. Keep it short.

| Ambitions             | Struggles             | Growth            |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| _Build a Reputation_  | _Come Unraveled_      | _Embrace Change_  |
| _Explore the World_   | _Doubt Convictions_   | _Escape My Past_  |
| _Finish the Missions_ | _Feed My Vices_       | _Find Belonging_  |
| _Make Things Right_   | _Flirt with Betrayal_ | _Just Enjoy Life_ |
| _Satisfy Desires_     | _Keep a Secret_       | _Prove Myself_    |
| _Uncover the Truth_   | _Survive the Storm_   | _Settle Debts_    |

**_Take a spark by resolving an arc_** with a meaningful moment, _however big or small it is_. This could mean achieving your goal, adjusting for the next step, or moving on from it entirely.

Group arc unite players around a theme, while character arcs help you express your own story. Most importantly, they give you authorial power - you can use story or tangles to add story details tied to your arcs to bring them into play!

Story arcs signal to the GM that you want **_drama, dilemmas_** and **_opportunities_** to rise around them. Aim to resolve arcs within 3-5 sessions to keep things fresh. For struggles, get group permission - limiting them to a few sessions and involving everyone makes it fun.

# Damage & Recovery
Sourcebook: Grimwild

## Marks

Light damage, a temporary hindrance to a stat. **_Take +1t on the next roll with that stat, then clear the mark._**

If a stat is already marked, you take **harm**  instead. As long as a stat is unmarked, even if you have its related harm, you can take a mark to it.

Marks are often combined with another mark or other consequences when inflicted directly. You also take a mark when you **push yourself**.

## Harm

Heavy damage to your mind or body, a lingering hindrance. **_This is the default damage from an impact move_** - though it can be split into
a couple of marks or other consequences.

- Heavy physical damage or stacked marks to Brawn or Agility leave you **bloodied**.
- Heavy mental damage or stacked marks to Wits or Presence leave you **rattled**.

**_Bloodied and rattled inflict +1t each on all rolls._** Taking a type of harm for the second time leaves you dropped - you're out of the scene. Make a story roll (usually 2d) - on a perfect, you're merely out until the scene ends. On a messy, things get **_even worse_**, like also taking on a condition (_4d dying_, _broken leg_, _trauma_). On a grim, things get far worse, like dying or taking on a permanent condition (_insanity_, _morality shift_).  Damage should match the tone of the scene - **tame stakes** might inflict a mark, while **dire stakes** might inflict both harm and dropped at once.

## Vex

An intense flash of emotion like _anger, fear, or confusion_. Vex is inflicted as a consequence, sometimes in addition to a mark or harm. Vex prompts an immediate, instinctive response. Choose one from **fight, flight, freeze** or **freakout**.

Interpret the response, which usually lasts a beat or two. Your PC is driven by _emotion_, but you decide how it plays out. Aim to balance what's fun, what fits the story, and what flows from the emotion.

## Conditions

Specific injuries or maladies that impact only relevant situations and are often lasting. They often come combined with harm or a mark, and can be:

- **_Urgent_**.
- **_Short-term_**.
- **_Long-term_**.
- **_Permanent_**.

**_Take +1t when a condition specifically hinders a roll_**. Conditions can also reduce your vantage, which can prohibit a roll.

Conditions clear when it makes sense, life after a scene, with rest, or when a pool tracking them depletes. They may also require treatment or another specific method to clear them.

**_You have final say on long-term and permanent conditions_**. When you take one, work with the GM to find a good fit for your PC and the situation.

## Treatment

Harm can be cleared with **_treatment_**, which requires _time_, _tools_,  and _training_. Treatment always carries risk, requiring an action roll. On a messy, they recover but other problems arise (_left with a mark_, _takes longer than expected_). On a grim, you aggravate the situation (_long-term condition_, _death_).

**_Marks can't benefit from treatment_**. They are light enough already that only time heals them; cleared with rest, rolling, or specific talents.

**_Conditions can be treated when it makes sense_**, which might require working towards a task pool or fulfilling specific requirements before it clears.

## Rest

A stretch of time between significant action. Paced for drama, not realism. **_Clear all marks and harm_**.

## Downtime

Extended breaks. Fully heal, including relevant conditions, and reset per-session talents. The GM rolls faction pools, then picks one and depletes it completely to move the story forward.

# Odds & Ends
Sourcebook: Grimwild

## Potency

The ability to pull off _jaw-dropping_ feats. When you have potency on a task, you ignore thorns from difficulty (_but not from other sources like damage_) and can attempt normally impossible (+3t) tasks. A **potent feat** can do things like:

- **_Group action_**: Something a team of people could accomplish with an action.
- **_Stretching Limits_**: Something just beyond normal human limitations.
- **_Mystical_**: Feats that don't fit in with the above, but have a similar narrative impact.

Potency is only concerned with difficulty thorns. It alters rolls with thorns from difficulty as such:

- **+3t**/impossible rolls become +0t/_tough_.
- **+1t**/**+2t** rolls become +0t/_tough_.
- **+0t** rolls are automatically successful if there are no thorns from other sources.
- On a messy or perfect on a +0t/+1t/+2t (from
difficulty) you gain greater effect (as a critical).

There's a _gray zone_ between jaw-dropping and too much. Something +3t is ok, but +4t is too far.

## Power Pools

The power of some talents or items, rolled in place of a stat. The same roll determines the outcome and drops dice from the pool. Even if it's automatically successful, still roll the pool when used and drop dice. You must roll all dice in the pool. The talent or item is used.

## Interrupt

Make an action roll to try to stop an impact move. This requires a specific talent. If not already involved, you now share the risk. On a messy, the GM takes or keeps suspense.

## Buffs

Beneficial effects that expand vantage, ease tasks, make rolls unnecessary, or provide outside assistance. If you give a buff to an ally that persists in your absence, you can assist relevant rolls without risk.

## Spark

Spark carries over each session and you can spend multiple spark on a single roll.

## Quarrels

Conflicts between PCs — arguments, competitions, or even violence. Quickly resolve impasses in the story — don't waste time debating! **_First, make sure all players agree to the quarrel_**. Clearly state the stakes for winning and losing, erring on the side of dramatic. **_Each player rolls 2d and the highest wins_**. Others can assist, or they can join at 2d with their own agenda. On a tie, compromise or keep quarreling.

The winner narrates how they won. Then, the loser narrates how they handle losing. The results of the quarrel are **final** — it's okay for the PC that lost to be bitter, but the story moves in the winner's direction. **_Both sides take spark._**

## Push Yourself

Expend extra effort to activate certain talents that require it. After using the talent, **_mark a related stat_** (_your choice_). Talents that require you to push yourself can be activated without a mark once per session.

## Always

If you have the ability to **_always_** succeed or receive a benefit, it holds true **_unless_** the GM makes a **Counter** move, a strong NPC trait is in play, or other extenuating circumstances arise. _In short, "always" means 95% of the time._

## Pre-session recap

Before each session (after
the first), recall the previous session and share your PC's best moment. Each player takes spark. When all are finished, the GM Recaps (taking suspense) tying all of these moments together into a proper "Previously on..." and starts the session.

## Post-session XP

After each session, **_take 1 XP_** and fill in its box. You start at level 1 and advance when you fill boxes equal to the next level (Lvl. 4 to 5 = 5 more boxes). This lets you choose a **_new talent_**.

**_The GM can award 1 bonus XP for a standout session_** (_about 1 in 4_). For a slower pace, slash each XP box before filling it.

## Level

A PC starts at level 1 and can go up to level 7. This takes 6 months of weekly play. For longer play, slow down progression.

# Running Moxie
Sourcebook: Grimwild

As the GM, you play the game by a different set of rules, utilizing the tools laid out in this chapter to craft an engaging and dynamic game. You wield GM moves and suspense to drive the narrative forward, challenges to model difficult tasks, the combat kit to create thrilling battles, and story rolls along with the GM crucible for inspiration when the unexpected arises.

Your primary role is mapping fiction to mechanics, keeping the players immersed in the story while you seamlessly weave the rules into the narrative, and know when to instead ditch a rule and just let the narrative take over.

Above all, be creative. Use the mechanics as a springboard to manufacture drama, tension, and memorable moments.

# Story Rolls
Sourcebook: Grimwild

Roll to disclaim decision-making, letting the dice decide story questions when you don’t want to, like an NPC’s reaction, off-screen action, or how good or bad something that just happened is. You can also collapse any rule back to a story roll when there's no specific mechanic to map it to. Roll dice based on the odds of a favorable outcome for the chosen perspective. _Are you rolling for the fish or the fisherman?_

Use **1d for Bad Odds, 2d for Even Odds** and **3d for Good Odds**.

- **Perfect**: It's the ideal situation.
- **Messy**: It's okay, but there's a catch.
- **Grim**: It's not good, and now it's a problem.

## GM Crucible

A forge for inspiration, encouraging emergent, low-prep gameplay. Turn to the GM crucible, often along with a story roll, when you want the seed of an idea to expand upon to help answer questions about the story. Roll once on each table. Each roll gives two results _(3, 1 = 31: precarious or 13: broken)_. Let your mind drift towards the most evocative, then drill down on it and interpret what it might mean.

# Moves
Sourcebook: Grimwild

A framework for good GMing practices and **_the rules that you, the GM, play by_**. While they can be called out specifically, they typically sit in the background left unsaid, aligning naturally with what you do as GM.

- **_Story moves_** set up scenes and pace the game. They hint at problems and give players a chance to react to what's happening. _Make these moves as you like at any time._
- **_Suspense moves_** help the players out in some way or escalate tension. **_Take suspense when used._** _Make these moves with good timing._
- **_Impact moves_** deal significant consequences, crank up the tension, and make the world feel powerful. _Make these moves when prompted._

## Prompt

A trigger for you to make an impact move, caused by things like grim or messy action rolls, a relevant depleted pool, an unaddressed _Foreshadow_ move, or by spending suspense.

## Suspense

_Pure rising tension and cinematic timing_. Gain suspense by skipping a prompted impact move or making a suspense move. Spend it to prompt an impact move at any time.

Skipping an impact move feels like the PCs got off lucky — something should have happened, but didn't. That lingering suspense builds tension, ready to strike later. Use this when no immediate move feels compelling or when you want to shift focus to other scenes.

## Hit With Impact

### Consequences

What happens when things go wrong — from failed rolls, timers, or impact moves. They should feel **_hard but fair_**, reflecting the stakes and severity of the situation. Every roll carries risk; otherwise, assume success and move on.

Damage is a solid baseline: in a fight, injuries leave you bloodied by default. Other consequences, even narrative ones, should sting just as much. There’s no strict formula — _it’s a gut feeling_. Let the fiction guide you, and make sure to give the fiction its teeth.

**_You can split consequences, breaking big consequences into smaller ones._** Multiple effects can be just as effective and make more sense in the situation. You might break up bloodied into a few marks, or rattled becoming vex and rolling a pool instead. Splits make the story move in multiple directions.

You can also spread consequences, hitting multiple PCs, nearby NPCs, or even a PC who didn't prompt the move. Consequences can be identical, vary in severity, or differ entirely. If a PC other than the one prompting it is hit, they get a defense roll. Spreads make the impact feel broader and pulling more people into a dynamic scene.

### Thinking Offscreen

Fallout that happens beyond the immediate action. Not all consequences need to occur in the spotlight. Hitting elsewhere builds tension, hastens incoming trouble, or creates missed opportunities. These unseen events make the world feel alive, adding depth beyond the present moment.

### Using Pools

Building pressure with danger or timer pools. Start or roll a danger or timer pool as another outlet for consequences, often **_offscreen_**. These create looming threats and situations the PCs want to avoid or mitigate. They build pressure and offer a strong alternative to skipping the move and banking suspense.

### Stakes

Framing danger when it's not the default. Most rolls assume meaningful consequences. Declaring **dire stakes** before a roll or situation signals severe stakes - death or worse looms. **Tame stakes** shifts outcomes into lighter territory, rolling for things you'd normally skip, with softer consequences. It's a tool for tone, moving between intense and light play.

### Taking Suspense

When nothing comes to mind, skip the impact move and take suspense instead!

## Story Moves

Keep the narrative flowing, the action engaging, and get things moving when they stall out. Player actions drive the story, and story moves nudge them forward. That doesn't mean the world is passive — you can describe anything happening that makes sense. However, from a story and gameplay perspective, it's more satisfying when the players have **_fair warning_** about trouble. They know actions have consequences and suspense you've earned can come back to bite them. This feels fair, so outside of these you give them the initiative. It shows things aren't arbitrary — **_the GM is also playing the game, just by different rules_**.

### Foreshadow

**Hint at trouble, sometimes with a timer pool. Prompts a later impact move.**

_Foreshadow_ to signal upcoming threats and give the players a chance to react. This is a great way to introduce adversity when you don't have or want to spend suspense. If they fail to deal with it or ignore the danger, it prompts an impact move and the pace of the story picks up.

### Question

**Ask provocative questions to stir up drama or flesh out the world.**

_Question_ players to help suss out what kind of story they're interested in, share the creative load, and keep the story fresh for yourself. Try to keep this focused on their character's perspective, but feel free to dip into the meta channel here and talk directly as players about what you all want to see play out in game.

### Set The Scene

**Use a story roll to determine how a scene starts off when it’s unclear.**

_Set The Scene_ when you're unsure about the specifics of the current fiction or want to dive straight into the action. Skip detailed planning and cautious leadups that often drag gameplay down. Instead, **_jump straight into the action_**, an in medias res shot of things already in motion! The roll sets the opening mood and stakes for the scene. On a grim, it can even trigger an impact move, kicking things off with a bang and raising tension right away.

### Spotlight

**Focus attention on a PC, encouraging them to act or follow-up.**

_Spotlight_ PCs to help direct the action, ensure no one is left out, and put focus where it's needed. This prompts players towards action. Mix in cinematic language like "_We cut to..._" or "_The camera pans over to show..._" as you use the "camera", your group's shared imagination space. Cut back and forth between PCs and scenes to build tension and avoid focusing on a single PC for too long.

### Wrap It Up

**Call for a montage roll or jump to a likely conclusion to a scene.**

_Wrap It Up_ when a scene has served its purpose, grown stale, or feels like a foregone conclusion. Don't waste game time on these. Closing these scenes out decisively keeps the narrative tight and focuses on what's next.

## Suspense Moves

Create familiar moments inspired by TV shows, incentivizing you mechanically to take the time to structure the story cinematically. **_You earn suspense_**, so they reward you for handling some of the tedium of GMing and remind players to stay engaged. Suspense keeps the world active when things stall. When your supply of suspense runs dry, you can use these to jumpstart the action again. However, use them carefully — **_overuse_** can get frustrating for players, so pick your spots. But **_timely_** use makes good, cinematic sense.

### Bridge

**Resolve a problem the PCs face or use exposition to connect some dots.**

_Bridge_ a scene when players are stuck, backed into a corner, or a scene feels dull. It provides a quick out and moves the story forward. Normally, it would feel like an unearned freebie, the suspense you gain makes it a **_fair trade_**. Never use it when players are engaged — save it for when it's needed.

### Buildup

**Give spark to each PC, who give a brief vignette before upcoming action.**

_Buildup_ to focus in tight on your PCs, and to create moments that set the stage for major events. These vignettes, whether a quiet campfire scene or tense moment before a battle, give players a chance to add depth and feeling to their characters that might get overlooked, and the "**_free_**" spark they gain lets them know that what's ahead is going to be a real challenge.

### Cutaway

**Narrate an info-rich scene elsewhere, clueing the players in.**

_Cutaway_ to clue players in on the bigger picture, like a TV show scene. Show villains plotting, armies marching, or even positive events. It’s more fun when players know what's happening and they can steer their PCs' actions toward that drama, even if their characters don't explicitly know about it.

### Entangle

**Propose an interesting tangle to a PC. Take suspense only if they accept.**

_Entangle_ a player by proposing a juicy tangle for their PC. Push **_dilemmas_** and **_drama_** towards their traits, desires, bonds, and story arcs. The players pick them because they want the choices that come with! When you have a great idea, propose a tangle for a PC. Remember you only gain suspense if they accept, so it's up to you to make the tangle irresistible. Don't push hard — this mechanic is built to respect player agency. Don't punish for saying no.

### Recap

**Summarize the last session or events further in the past.**

_Recap_ at the start of each session to get everyone on the same page. Hearing the last session's events builds tension for what's to come. The suspense you gain can immediately push the action, or hang over their heads. If a player wants to recap, skip taking the suspense! You can also use a mid-session _Recap_ to remind players of a vital piece of information they've forgotten.

## Impact Moves

Deliver hard-hitting consequence that challenge PCs and push the action forward. They require prompting, so when you use them, they're sure to be justified and fair, codified into the rules. They've had fair warning and should have an idea of the risks. So when you make a move, make sure it has **IMPACT** to ensure the choices leading to them matter and the world feels powerful.

When not prompted by a roll, impact moves directly against a PC give them a defense roll. Some talents also give the ability to interrupt impact moves, possibly negating them. If the roll to interrupt is a messy, you take suspense or keep it if you spent it to prompt the move.

### Complicate Things

**Escalate a situation, introduce a new problem, or pressure a bond.**

_Complicate Things_ to add twists and elevate drama. Use it when things feel too stable or you want things to be even more chaotic than they already are. It's also great for adding a thorn to a roll by introducing sudden environmental obstacles, a great outlet for extra suspense that doesn't introduce new drama.

### Counter

**Deny things a PC can always do or negate something they did.**

_Counter_ to make the world tenaciously formidable, showing that it won't just roll over. You can stop anything a PC does, including successful action rolls, talents they "always" have permission to use and extra vigilance. If they use a talent that costs them resources, they generally don't have to expend that resource (your call) but can't quickly use it again. However, this can never be used to stop defense rolls and criticals — don't steal their thunder. Be careful, players get frustrated if their victories and advantages are snatched away, so use it in interesting ways and make sure the spotlight works its way back to them after you take advantage of the moment.

### Force A Choice

**Present tough options, with room to only choose one.**

_Force A Choice_ to present stark, binary decisions that they can't wiggle their way out of. This move offers no easy way out. When you use it, make sure to follow through without softening the impact. This adds a real cinematic edge, reflecting the truly difficult decisions protagonists must face.

### Hit 'Em Hard

**Inflict damage on a PC, like bloodied, rattled, vex, marks, or a condition.**

_Hit 'Em Hard_ when you need to inflict direct consequences. Whether it’s damage, betrayal, or loss, this move underscores the seriousness of the situation. It's a heavy reminder that the world pushes back against their actions. When you use it, you should be hitting them just as hard as they're trying to hit the world.

### Lock It In

**Declare something occurs, closing off immediate attempts to change it.**

_Lock It In_ to definitively close off an opportunity and close out a scene that's threatening to drag on. Players can be tenacious and keep trying to find some way to not be defeated. This puts a definitive end to a situation. It makes follow-up attempts impossible, which refocuses players' attention forward rather than trying to find yet another way to attempt something they've already failed at.

# Challenges
Sourcebook: Grimwild

A framework to represent **_tasks_**, **_obstacles_**, **_enemies_**, and scenarios that have greater tenacity and complexity than a single action can accomplish. **Challenges** allow you to track progress towards them, but also proactively oppose the PCs. Each has **_2 bonus suspense_** to be spent on moves relating to it, and a **_task pool_** to represent its tenacity or complexity. They can also have:

- **Traits**: Qualities they have with strong narrative impact, inflicting thorns, denying permissions, or changing vantage.
- **Moves**: Suggested impact moves they might make. These are examples, not limitations.
- **Fail States**: A trigger that signals the challenge failed, like a competing timer pool or a specific event. It prompts _Lock It In_.

Interpret these short, evocative phrases as fit the situation. Keep your own created challenges similarly brief and flexible. Some uses:

- Create a dangerous enemy or exceptionally tough task.
- Zoom in on pivotal moments.
- Zoom out to collapse related tasks into one objective.
- Turn a broad concept into an actionable objective.

## Building Challenges

1. **_Assign a task pool_** (4d, 6d, 8d) for its tenacity.
2. **_Add traits_** (1 or 2) that shape the situation. Skip the obvious _(storm is windy)_ and highlight what matters _(strong winds are blinding)_. Keep them brief and evocative.
3. **_List short, punchy moves_** (2 or 3) with flexible interpretations. These are examples, not limits. You can spend bonus suspense on other moves, or trigger these when an impact move is prompted by something else.
4. Define a fail state, a specific trigger that prevents that challenge from being accomplished. Avoid obvious outcomes _(dying in a fight)_ and focus on what creates tension _(breaking a code of honor)_. Players should know the fail state unless mystery is part of the fun — and even then, make it clear one is in play.

**Note**: _Not all of these parts are needed for a challenge._

## Using Challenges

Challenges are for moments of narrative importance. They make whatever you assign them to a proactive element in the story. Use them to spotlight what's happening — not because it's harder, but because it deserves proper screen time and presence. Introduce challenges at times like:

- An impact move is prompted.
- You _Foreshadow_ to give them fair warning.
- You _Complicate Things_ without warning.
- The PCs head straight towards trouble on their own.

## Linked Challenges

**Linked challenges** are greater, more complex interactions, like epically powerful enemies or unbelievably tense social situations. Each part of the whole has its own proactive presence in the scene. Give them traits that prompt impact moves, triggered by the fiction for dynamic interactions.

## Examples

- **8d | _Boss Guy_ | 2 suspense**
  - **Traits**: _Ruthless_
  - **Moves**: _Big Weapon_, _Command Subordinates_
  - **Fail States**:
    - _He Gets What He Wants_

# Vigilance
Sourcebook: Grimwild

The assumed alertness of the PCs, avoiding overly cautious gameplay to keep the focus on the action.

**_PCs are always considered to be as vigilant as their vantage allows_** when dealing with hidden dangers like _traps_, _lies_, or _secret doors_. However, this doesn't mean they are always aware of hidden threats. Instead, the GM uses a gut feeling to decide how much the PC perceives based on their vantage and the type of tension the GM wants to build.

Each of the three levels of vigilance creates a different dynamic in the scene, a different view of PC competence and the danger of the world. These three levels are: **hint**, **reveal**, and **strike**.

## Hint

_Foreshadow_ with a subtle clue about a hidden element. **_The player_** gets a single chance to interpret the situation. They're limited to just one to highlight the natural response of the PC and to keep things flowing. **_Player intuition guides the story forward._** A correct response leads to a reveal or possibly bypasses the situation entirely.

## Reveal

_Foreshadow_ with an obvious unveiling of an immediately imminent threat. **_The PC_** that becomes aware has one chance to react before the danger strikes. **_Character competence guides the story forward._**

## Strike

Make an impact move as the danger immediately strikes them. **_The GM_** assumes the PCs were not vigilant enough. **_The dangerous world guides the story forward._**

# Factions
Sourcebook: Grimwild

Track off-screen developments of major forces, creating a feeling of a living world beyond the PCs. They have:

- **Resources** that show their power and influence, like assets, traits and relationships.
- **Goals** that show their ambitions. Track each with a timer called a **faction pool**, rolled between sessions or when triggered by events in the story.

When a faction pool depletes, the goal is either accomplished or they make their move against another faction, with a story roll in their favor determining how it plays out.

Keep 4-6 active factions, balancing major and minor ones, with competing goals. Replace factions that are no longer relevant to the story.

## Campaign Pools

Timers that pace long-term events across sessions. They work like faction pools but don’t require faction details. Use them to signal upcoming events or remind you to reintroduce plotlines.

## Examples

- **Faction**

  - **Resources**: _Leadership, Money, Assets_
  - **Goals**: _4d Get Thing, 6d Do Thing_

- **Campaign Pool**

  - **Resources**: _Stuff That Makes Things Happen_
  - **Goals**: _4d Thing Happens, 6d Other Thing Happens_

# GM With Moxie
Sourcebook: Grimwild

## Map Fiction To Rules

Encourage players to focus on the fiction and let you handle the rules. The more narratively important something is, the more mechanical weight you should give it.

Get creative applying the rules, mixing them up in ways not explicitly laid out. Don't be afraid to tinker. Moxie is modular and you're not going to break it. Graft on rules from other systems you like, or hack Moxie and make it your own.

If the rules clash with what makes sense in the fiction, the fiction wins. Engage with the rules quickly, resolve them, and return to the story.

## Make Rulings To Fill Gaps

The rules are a flexible framework and designed not to cover every detail. When things fall through the cracks, try to interpret the rules' intent and make a ruling that fits the moment. If it's a judgment call, tell the players. If you're unsure of a rule, make a quick call now and check later. When in doubt, everything can collapse down to a single story roll — ask the players what they want to happen, then roll to see if that's how it goes down.

## Pace The Game Cinematically

Keep the game flowing like a well-paced movie. Don't let scenes drag, _Wrap It Up_ to move on to something more interesting. If players don't seem keen on an upcoming situation, suggest a montage. Skip long planning phases by cutting to the action with a _Set the Scene_ move. Reward players buying into these techniques by giving them good odds.

## Follow The Players' Lead

Keep tabs on story arcs and present _drama_, _dilemmas_, and _opportunities_ related to them. Follow where the characters want to go. Present interesting situations related to it. When players hesitate or hit an impasse, spur them into action with danger timers, quarrels, _Entangles_, or _Bridge_ and move on.

## Use The Moves, Or Don't

The GM moves can be explicit rules, merely guidelines, or somewhere in between. Some GMs will call them out by name, while others never bring them up at all. Either way, as long as your GMing aligns with their intent, you're doing it right.

## Make Moves With Impact

Don't pull your punches — impact moves are called that for a reason. They shove the story forward. Players have a lot of tools at their disposal, so **_give the world teeth_**. It makes victory even sweeter.

A single impact move is flexible. You can split it up into a few lesser effects, hit multiple PCs at once, or have a PC's action affect a totally different PC, though they do get a defense roll in that case.

When an impact move doesn't naturally flow from what's happening on-screen (_common with messy rolls_), think off-screen instead and complicate their lives elsewhere or take suspense and hit later with better dramatic timing.

## Prompt Player Narration

After a roll, make sure the players narrate how things play out — even, or especially, on a grim. Describing failure is a great way to express their character. Collaborate, but keep them narrating their actions.

Encourage them to play off of each other as well, especially with assists and montages. Ask for reaction shots as other PCs' scenes play out to gauge how they feel about it, or how their bond affects their reaction.

Most importantly, after the rules come into play, get right back to narration. Make sure that the flow remains **_fiction, to rules, to fiction_**.

## Be Endlessly Curious

Ask provocative questions about the PCs and their motivations to give players a chance to expand on their characters.

- _Why in the world would you do that?_
- _Okay, so who'd you steal that from?_
- _So are you pissed off or cool with it?_

# Combat
Sourcebook: Grimwild

## Combat Kit

GM tools to create dynamic **_antagonists_** and **_combat scenarios_** quickly. **Tier** is an opponent's threat level. **Role** is a keyword used to guide its behavior in battle to vary its tactics. **Battlegrounds** make the environment a proactive or obstacle-ridden part of the scene. Mix these for dynamic combats.

### Tiers

- **Mook**
  - Mostly just _set dressing_.
  - One action roll can take out several.
  - Large groups can be a task pool.
- **Tough**
  - A typical, dangerous enemy.
  - One action roll can take out one of them.
  - Small groups can be a task pool.
- **Elite**
  - Strong scene presence.
  - A 4d/6d challenge.
  - Often leads a group of lesser enemies.
- **Boss**
  - Commands the scene.
  - A 6d/8d challenge or linked challenge.
  - Extremely powerful.

### Roles

- **Blaster**
- **Brute**
- **Lurker**
- **Marksman**
- **Overseer**
- **Marauder**
- **Predator**
- **Protector**
- **Skirmisher**
- **Swarmer**
- **Tactician**
- **Trickster**

### Battleground

Make the location an important, proactive part of the scene. Identify environmental elements to bring into play.

- **Features**: Elements likely to impact, usually complicating, the ongoing action. _They have a strong effect on vantage and difficulty_.
- **Threats**: Hazards that present extra dangers. They either get 2 suspense or repeat on a timer. _They have a strong proactive presence in the scene_.

### Example

**Note**: Enemies gathered into a single task pool are listed with the dice in front _(4d Enemies)_. Challenges are shown with a | after the pool _(8d | Challenge)_.

- **_Battleground_**
  - **Features**: _Dangerous Feature #1, Dangerous Feature #2_
  - **Threats**: _4d Threat_, _2 suspense for Bigger Threat_
  - **Challenges**:
    - 4d Random Guys _(Mook Blasters)_
    - 1 Lieutenant Guy _(Elite Brute)_
    - 8d | Boss Guy _(Boss Overseer)_

## Running Combat

When a fight breaks out, the action flows naturally, following the spotlight. There are no specific rules that differentiate combat from any other scene.

**_There's no turn order._** The GM describes the impending danger in the current situation and asks how the PCs respond, or the PCs take action on their own. The spotlight is often on the PCs, and the world's actions flow from what they do. You make enemies more proactive by _Foreshadowing_ events and following up after, or spending suspense to make impact moves. This results in a cinematic ebb and flow to combat.

**_Battles occur in the theater of the mind_**, using the
group's shared imagination to keep track of each participant's fictional positioning to map fiction to rules. However, using **_battlemaps_** or sketching maps with minis or markers to track locations during a fight works well, too. This helps organize the chaotic situation, makes sure everyone gets time to shine, and keeps everyone's imagination aligned. Don't get caught up in detailed tracking — update the map with big changes.

### Combat Rulings

You map the fiction to the rules just like any scene, making rulings to fill in gaps. However, in combat you'll often see the same scenarios come up, so for the sake of consistency, some common rulings:

**Movement**: Moving usually accompanies another action — the goal isn't just to get somewhere, but to get there and do something. If an interesting obstacle blocks the way, it needs an action roll.

**Weapons**: Compare the weapons in play and use common sense to resolve any issues. Most weapons are evenly matched; the roll only shifts if there's a clear imbalance.

**Melee combat**: Most melee attacks use Brawn, while light, fast weapons rely on Agility. Dirty tricks call for Wits, but rarely work more than once.

**Ranged combat**: Precision attacks roll Agility, while thrown weapons use Brawn or Agility based on weight and range. Charging an enemy with ranged weapons is reckless, adding +1t or requiring a separate action to close the gap.

**Defense Rolls**: The GM selects the stat to test. Melee attacks are dodged with Agility, blocked with Brawn (using armor or shields), anticipated with Wits, or keeping your nerve with Presence.

**Armor**: Armor and shields are represented by talents. Otherwise, they are vantage and set dressing for defense rolls.

**Vulnerabilities**: Exploiting a vulnerability can lower thorns, drop 1 before rolling a pool, or even bypass the need for a roll. In some cases, finding a vulnerability is required to attack at all.

**Ranged vs. Melee**: Precise ranged attacks demand focus, which is tough with nearby threats. Inflict +1t to these rolls when under immediate danger.

# Spellcasting
Sourcebook: Grimwild

**Spellcasting** is the ability to harness magic, acquired through talents or arcana. While each style has its quirks, they all follow the same _laws of magic_. Spells are cast using **touchstones** — key terms like spell names, godly domains, or item descriptions. You interpret these on-the-fly, defining the permissions and limitations of your magic when you cast. Each source clearly defines its touchstones, casting methods, and costs.

Magic has four magnitudes: **cantrips**, **spells**, **potent spells**, and **rituals**. Determine the magic's magnitude by comparing:

- The **_final result_**, not the method, to what can be achieved by a non-magic action roll.
- The **_narrative impact_**, not the result, to the impact of a normal action roll.

**Final result** is used to judge most cases, seeing if the magic is replicating what can be done through non-magic means. The second is then used when the first isn't possible.

**Narrative impact** is used to judge spellcasting results without mundane equivalents, to ensure that magic and non-magic means have the same overall impact on the story.

The GM uses the guideline and examples on these pages to set the line between spells and potent spells, as well as the upper limit — beyond extraordinary magic (+4t), only accomplishable with rituals. This is a judgment call set through play, so transparency and consistency are key.

- **Cantrips** are similar to something that doesn't require a roll. They should feel **_flavorful_**.
- **Spells** are similar to an action roll, impactful but not dominating a scene. They should feel **_useful_**.
- **Potent spells** are similar to a group effort, effort over time, or a single effort with potency. They should feel **_powerful_**.

## Cantrips

**Cantrips** are _set dressing_, minor effects that don't require rolls. Success is automatic.

**_Cantrip utility_** lets you flavor other action rolls with cantrips, or even use them to replace gear when using relevant touchstones. This reasonably expands vantage. You roll the stat you'd normally roll for the now-possible action, like Brawn or Agility to swing a conjured sword.

## Spells

**Spells** have effects equal to an action roll, results one person with the right training and tools can achieve. They're the baseline magnitude of magic

## Potent Spells

**_Potent spells_** accomplish more than a normal spell — **_they give potency and broaden vantage_**. A potent spell can achieve effects equal to an entire group working together, as with normal potency. You can attempt _jaw-dropping_ effects (+3t/difficulty). A normally +1t or +2t task has _greater effect_ (critical bonus), and a +0t roll is automatic.

## Touchstones

Spellcasting ability comes with touchstones and all magic effects must logically align with them, making sense and feeling natural. If it feels like a _reach_, it’s beyond the touchstone’s bounds.

**_The GM can veto spells that don't align with your touchstones_**. They can also instead allow it, but inflict a thorn or collateral effects when it's pushing your touchstones, but not _completely_ implausible.

### Limitations

When you take a magic talent, have a discussion with the GM about what your magic can and can't do. Clearly defining it in this way makes the magic more fun to play with - **_creativity thrives within limitations_**. If a PC's magic feels too broad during the campaign, consider discussing new limitations to keep it balanced and engaging.

## Spellcasting Rulings

Spellcasting's a freeform system, built on flexibility and creative rulings from the GM, with the understanding that its freedom is meant to preserve the feeling of magic. While this system can be exploited in unfun ways aimed at "winning," it relies on you buying into your magic touchstones and the magnitudes of magic. **_Don't be a weasel_** — play in good faith and have fun with the freedom it gives you. With that in mind, here are some common rulings for various situations involving magic:

### Magic Trappings

Discuss with the GM how your casting appears, its visual style, movements you make, and tools you use. All magic is clear and evident — trying to hide it is extremely difficult at best, but usually impossible. Losing implements or being hindered can deny permission to cast or inflict thorns.

### Magic On Defense Rolls

The GM chooses the stat for defense rolls, and can choose to let you use spellcasting. This counts as set dressing and doesn't cost a resource, like dice dropped from a pool. If the GM calls for another stat, but you have a clear spell-based counter, you can ask them if you have time to cast a spell instead. This is a spell as usual and it's the GM's choice if you have time.

### Assisting With Magic

Using magic to assist a roll is just _set dressing_ with no cost — just keep the narration reasonable _(the weaker end of a spell)_. Remember you're assisting. If you're making the action roll on a group level, cast as usual.

### Detecting Magic

With a relevant touchstone, you can recognize magic easily. Without one, it's harder, though magic ability counts as a factor. Without training, the magic must be very obvious to be noticed.

### Dispelling Magic

Anyone aware that something is magic can try to dispel it. This does not require training—you can cast a spell with relevant touchstones that counters it, cause enough of a disturbance to it, or outsmarting the magic's logic in some way. Creativity should be rewarded here.

### Healing Magic

Spells can clear marks, heal minor conditions, or calm a vex response. Potent spells can pull off +3t/_impossible_ healing, such as healing
harm instantly or curing major conditions (_mend
a broken bone, but not a severed arm_). Rituals are needed for more extreme conditions like regrowing limbs, curing blindness, or removing deep trauma.

### Resurrection

Bringing back the dead is a costly, extremely risky ritual rarely worth the price you'll surely have to pay. Tread carefully.

### Buffs And Debuffs

Spells that help or hinder are considered on a case-by-case basis, with the player and GM working together. As a starting point, a buff can apply the effects of a **_critical_**: _greater effect — secondary effect — setup_. Debuffs can do the same against anyone working against the foe. They can also add vantage. Potent buffs might last longer, affect multiple targets, make +0t rolls automatically successful, or allow for a potent feat. Get creative with applying the mechanics and capture the feeling the spell is going for.

### Magic Duration

As a rule of thumb, a spell lasts just a moment, maybe two, and a potent spell lasts for a scene. This is judged by the GM based on the intended effect, which you balance against the magnitude of spell.

### Potions

Magical items, like potions, that allow you to use them as tools require an action to apply, such as rolling Agility to throw and hit someone with a potion. The efficacy of a potion is usually automatic, based on what tier of potion it is, but you can make a story roll if it's unclear. The more powerful the potion, the more dice you roll for the story roll.

### Casters vs Melee

In combat, spellcasting works as a precise ranged attack, demanding focus, which is tough with nearby threats. Inflict +1t to these rolls when under immediate danger.

### Enemy Magic

Enemy magic doesn't follow the same rules as PC magic. It manifests through GM moves and is constrained only by the fiction.

## Rituals

**Rituals** can accomplish magical effects far beyond what can be done with even potent spells, equal to the labor of an entire team of people over an extended period, effects that can have significant impact on the world, or push the very limits of implausibility. **Casting a ritual consists of 3 parts**:

- Possess a **source of magic** with relevant touchstones.
- **Anchor** the ritual to the physical and metaphysical realms.
- Complete the ritual's **rites** to finalize its casting.

**Source of magic** can be a spellcasting talent or a scroll, potion, or other arcana. It might also be something creative like asking or tricking a monster into helping. Even a PC without magic ability can initiate a ritual as long as they have a source of magic.

**Anchors** for a ritual are chosen by the GM and players together. They should feel connected to the ritual's touchstones and intent, and match the intended impact of the ritual. **_Two or three anchors_**, like an _enchanted location_, some _exotic ingredients_ or _auspicious timing_, are best.

# Treasure
Sourcebook: Grimwild

Treasure is the currency of an adventurer, useful in trade with the powerful entities in the world to further your own aims. Your skills put you beyond worrying about the expenses of daily life and adventuring gear.

You deal in treasures — **_minor_**, **_major_**, and **_mythic_**, anything from a stash of gold to a rare artifact or magical item. While the treasure's label gives some indication of its value and the table below shows what you might get for it in trade, a treasure is only truly as valuable as what someone will give you for it.

Treasures are shared by the party, unless chosen otherwise. With each adventure, it's assumed that you're gaining some coin to spend on your own. Treasures are the things beyond that, valuable resources the party can leverage.

Hauling treasure isn't a problem unless the GM specifically makes it one. You can also assume that when a PC needs one of the party's treasures, they happen to have it on them if it makes sense. That is, unless the GM _Complicates Things_ (a **move**).

## Finding Treasure

When you gain treasure, the GM can either specify what it is or just give its tier and handwave it. If you want specifics on it later or it becomes important to the story, figure it out then. It's the GM's job to match up treasure and the nature of the adventure and campaign. When unsure about what exactly is found, they can use a story roll or GM crucible to help.

## Carousing

Any time you're in a settlement, you can carouse by selling off a minor treasure, with each PC spending their leisure time as they like. Make a montage roll and narrate — or suffer — the results. After the scenes finish up, everyone takes spark regardless of the roll.

## Arcana

Arcana are _rare artifacts of power_, magic imbued in them through ritual or other esoteric forces. They grant **_vantage_**, letting you do what's otherwise impossible, or greatly enhance specific tasks by granting outside assistance, at a cost. Some create strange, unique effects tied to their creator's intent. As always, it's the GM's role to map fiction to rules for each arcana. Arcana have the same tiers as treasure: **_minor_**, **_major_**, and **_mythic_**.

**An arcana's name and description serve as its touchstones**, while its tier reflects the magnitude of magic bound to it. Unlike the rigid _laws of magic_ governing PC magic, guidelines for arcana are looser, typically following this pattern:

- **_Minor arcana_** have _cantrip_ to _spell_-level effects.
- **_Major arcana_** have _spell_ to _potent spell_-level effects.
- **_Mythic arcana_** have _ritual_-level effects.

### Designing Arcana

Arcana are generally tools for the GM, crafted to fit the campaign. The **GM Crucible** is a great source of inspiration for designing them.

Arcana are what they are—they're truths within the fiction. They can do what their description says. A shortcut to creating one works like this, though. Start with an evocative name and a single touchstone word, then apply one or two Sorcery techniques: _attack — creation — defense — enhancement — hindrance — influence — transformation — traversal_. From that, you can build out the description. Or begin with the description and work backwards towards defining the touchstones.

- **Activation**: Requires spending spark, pushing yourself, or another resource to activate.
- **Limited Usage**: Has a resource or power pool, usually 4d. At 0d, it must be recharged by satisfying a specific anchor, like a ritual.

## Arcana Rulings

Arcana are as flexible as spellcasting — if not more so — and demand just as much creativity and GM rulings when used. Here are some examples:

### Wands And Similar

Bestow spellcasting ability on those wielding them. They have limited usage, a power pool rolled to cast from them. They don't require training to use.

### Potions And Similar

Potions have a magnitude one level higher than its tier. A _Minor Healing Potion_ can accomplish what a spell can (heal a mark). _Major potions_ are potent spell effects and _Mythic potions_ are ritual-level effects.

### Scrolls

Single-use arcana that match the tier of their effects, unlike other consumables. Lacking vantage to cast spells means you take thorns casting from them. Scrolls are also highly sought after for learning spells with the wizard's Spellcraft talent.

### Crafting Arcana

The act of binding magic to items requires a ritual and a source of magic with the proper touchstones to make it. A ritual of creation generally takes far longer, though is often less dangerous, than merely achieving the same effect through a ritual.

### Purchasing Arcana

Prices depend entirely on the seller's desires, usually something other than coin. Finding one for sale is exceedingly rare, but you might locate someone willing to craft it for you for the right price.
